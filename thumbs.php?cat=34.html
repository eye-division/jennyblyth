Drawing inspiration from post industrial landscape, Day has written her own alphabet and language of painting.

Flat colour planes, ink spills and ribbons of colour interleave symbols that once were gasometers, containers and huge concrete piping.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Perfected over years, Day creates abstract expressionist paintings that feel like jazz fusion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her paintings are charged and fluid - dynamic in form and joyous in palette. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Tahoma&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Urban Wastelands Project currently touring South West, started its UK tour at the Black Swan Arts as part of the Frome Arts Festival in July 2011, then toured to Dorchester Arts Centre, Kelly Ross Fine Art at The Art Stable, Dorset and travelled on to Quay Arts, Isle of Wight in February 2012.&nbsp; Currently showing at Atkinson Gallery, Somerset.&nbsp; Catalogue essay by Jenny Blyth&nbsp;:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Tahoma&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">When we cast our mind to the British coastline, we may recall blustery winds on high cliff tops and beautiful beaches, or by contrast that singularly British phenomenon of piers and fun fairs. Day Bowman&rsquo;s view of the British coastline is another vision entirely.&nbsp;&nbsp; For her it is the last frontier of wilderness.&nbsp;Growing up in Minehead in the fifties, she far preferred the beach out of season, and the long stretches of empty sands. &ldquo;I like that out of season emptiness, the windswept promenade, ripped hoardings, and closed-up shops and stalls.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is evidence of settlements around Minehead that go back to the Bronze Age, but the port at Minehead was established in the late 1300&rsquo;s and over five centuries grew to a thriving port, trading not only with Ireland and Wales for livestock, wool and coal, but sending ships as far a field as the West Indies and Virginia.&nbsp;As the &lsquo;glory days&rsquo; of the Industrial Age declined, Minehead was developed by the Edwardians into a residential seaside town, popular for holidays and retirement.&nbsp;The architecture of discarded industry is however still evident in the landscape, and it is this industrial wasteland that fires Day Bowman&rsquo;s new paintings.&nbsp;When pressed for the source of fascination for a landscape that is on the surface bleak, Bowman speaks in part of memory and loss. The childhood years that she spent exploring those wastelands had made a profound impression on her, but it was the departure from Minehead in primary years, a consequence of her parents separation, that triggered a longing and wistfulness for a landscape that to her remains exciting and dynamic - pyramids of coal too high to scramble over, reels of barbed wire, and hollow pipes large enough to walk through. &nbsp;But Bowman&rsquo;s journey of discovery through painting goes far beyond the personal, and it is exciting to see how her narrative unravels.&nbsp;&ldquo;When we think of the seaside we think of beautiful beaches, but much of our coastline is not like that.&nbsp;It is often a strange and unfamiliar wilderness. I find that the overlooked corners of our island offer an alternative view of architecture and how it has shaped the landscape&rdquo;.&nbsp;&ldquo;Water Zones&rdquo; and &ldquo;Urban Wastelands&rdquo; evolved out of earlier more personal projects such as &ldquo;The Compass&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sandmarking Series&rdquo;, her focus shifting from seaside resorts and beaches to the &lsquo;edgelands&rsquo; of a post-industrial era that border much of our coastline.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowman has broadened her narrative to embrace not only personal but also collective memories associated with transmigration.&nbsp;&nbsp; Introducing a sense of movement and journeying into the fabric of her work, Bowman reflects on the architecture of industrial wasteland created from disused quays, rusting hulks and oil drums that mark the point of departure and arrival for an ongoing exchange of stowaways, sailors and immigrants across the ages.&nbsp;Presented in association with &ldquo;Jonah and The Whale,&rdquo;a short film beautifully composed by award-winning film maker Ian Knox, and music by Steve Harris, &ldquo;Water Zones&rdquo; marked a turning point for Bowman, in which she identified and developed an alphabet of language with which to paint. Her alphabet consists of the disused gasometers, discarded containers, the rusting detritus of metal from objects no longer relevant or useful.&nbsp;The language that she has created celebrated the physicality and form of those objects, a literally hard edged and flinty figuration where those objects became paramount.&nbsp;You can see clearly looking at her composition in Water Zones and Urban Wastelands that Bowman&rsquo;s painting has grown out of collage, and indeed she remains faithful to that medium in smaller works.&nbsp;Having mastered the alphabet of the objects that informed Water Zones, she created Urban Wastelands using a language in which she has become fluent, and by freeing up her composition, she is able to create large beautiful contemporary paintings that fly.&nbsp;She describes the process as having &ldquo;to forget what you have learned, to loosen up and to simply make these marks which have now become a part of me&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her new body of abstracted paintings have therefore grown out of figuration, and are most successful on that hairline where figuration meets abstraction. &nbsp;Bowman retains her edge, but flat colour planes, ink spills and ribbons of colour interleave the shapes that reference symbols and marks which once were gasometers, containers and hollow piping.&nbsp;Through abstraction, and in spite of the gravitas of the narrative, there is a sense of delight in her gestural marking whereby the compositions become more about space, form, light and texture and the sheer enjoyment of painting.&nbsp;You can clearly perceive her influences and favoured masters, the colour and space of Irwin and De Kooning, the movement and dynamic of Bacon.&nbsp;Her palette is unfettered by the base subject matter where peach pinks and oranges sit unashamedly alongside gun metal grey.&nbsp;The Urban Wastelands Project presents paintings by Day Bowman in association with a remake of Ian Knox&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jonah and The Whale&rdquo;, and music from Trans Global Underground &ldquo;Unite &ndash; A gathering of Strangers&rdquo;. The music of Trans Global Underground is a haunting fusion of cultural influences from Arabic &ldquo;Call to Prayer&rdquo; to Celtic Folk. Infused with sadness and the longing for homes left far behind, the songs are set to the rhythmic beating of electronic instruments which echo the imagery of Knox&rsquo;s film and the texture and surface of concrete and metal inherent in Bowman&rsquo;s paintings.&nbsp;Embracing geo political issues of mass transmigration, The Urban Wastelands Project is a compelling journey through the tough forgotten corners of our marine wastelands that is both brittle and beautiful.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Tahoma&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Day Bowman&rsquo;s exhibition The Urban Wastelands Project has been touring the South West of UK since July 2011. Mich&egrave;le Jaff&eacute; Pearce is involved with The Three Faiths Forum and exhibited at the Interfaith Arts Festival organised by TFF at the Candid Arts Trust, Islington in January 2010. Jenny Blyth, curator and fine art consultant, is based in Oxford.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Tahoma&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;Mich&egrave;le Jaff&eacute;-Pearce trained in Fine Art at Sir John Cass and thereafter studied sculpture at Chelsea School of Art.&nbsp;Her painting is founded in a contemporary expression of faith through an exploration of Jewish mysticism, Chassidic stories, biblical poetry and the Hebrew alphabet.&nbsp;Mich&egrave;le uses symbolism and abstraction to create spiritual pathways on a journey of belief.&nbsp;Strong colour and form asserts a vibrant sense of optimism and a spirit of renewal.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Tahoma&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;Day Bowman&rsquo;s painting takes us on a compelling journey beyond our habitual comfort zones to the wild and deserted industrial wastelands that fringe our urban abode and infrastructure and our designated coastal countryside. Her paintings, which are both brittle and beautiful, celebrate these tough and forgotten &lsquo;Edgelands&rsquo;, exploring the twilight zone between figuration and abstraction. Day Bowman studied painting at Chelsea School of Art and London University.</span></p>
