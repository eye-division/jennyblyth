  Hours Daily : 11 am – 6 pm Email: jennyblyth@btconnect.com


  "I never tire of Port Meadow and have walked daily whatever the weather for
  years. I love the huge skies, and stepping onto the meadow that stretches
  towards Oxford, it presents like an old Dutch master, an ever-changing canvas.
  It is large enough to lose yourself in nature, to embrace the elements, and
  familiar enough to encourage a quiet meditation.


  The seasons transform the landscape, shape-shifting and refreshing the
  palette. There is invariably something unexpected and beautiful to observe
  whether that is a hawthorn bush heady with musk scented flowers, or a murmer
  of plover that contours the broad backs of horses, their long tails sashaying.
  Gun-metal skies threaten thunder over a buttercup ocean in May, while hoar
  frost on winter days crystalliizes the floodplains under high blue skies. In
  autumn, the last of the black poplars shed yellow leaves that fringe the edge
  of the river like a golden thread.


  I attempt to capture a sense of oneness in my photographs. I have always been
  drawn to the poetry in photography, and try to catch the moment as it feels on
  the day. I am not technicially minded, and shy away from photoshop so that the
  images are as true as they can be." &copy; Jenny Blyth 2017
