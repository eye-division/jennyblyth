  "I have spent a year through the seasons photographing Wolfson College and the
  gardens that run down to the River Cherwell.&nbsp; The Brutalist architecture
  was groundbreaking in its time and remains at odds in a city known for its
  dreaming spires.&nbsp; The gardens and trees are now matured, and nature has
  softened the geometry of the buildings creating reflections and shadows that
  play out across the surfaces changing colours, textures and moods so that each
  day and hour is different.&nbsp; I have been struck by the joy in the
  environment of Wolfson that was designed to engender 'humane' living.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;


  I walk daily whatever the weather and find a sense of oneness with nature that
  I attempt to capture in my photographs.&nbsp; I am drawn to the poetry in the
  landscape, and find that I am chasing beauty.


  I never tire of Port Meadow and have walked daily whatever the weather for
  years. I love the huge skies, and stepping onto the meadow that stretches
  towards Oxford, it presents like an old Dutch master, an ever-changing canvas.
  It is large enough to lose yourself in nature, to embrace the elements, and
  familiar enough to encourage a quiet meditation.


  The seasons transform the landscape, shape-shifting and refreshing the
  palette. There is invariably something unexpected and beautiful to observe
  whether that is a hawthorn bush heady with musk scented flowers, or a murmer
  of plover that contours the broad backs of horses, their long tails sashaying.
  Gun-metal skies threaten thunder over a buttercup ocean in May, while hoar
  frost on winter days crystalliizes the floodplains under high blue skies. In
  autumn, the last of the black poplars shed yellow leaves that fringe the edge
  of the river like a golden thread.


  I am not technicially minded, and shy away from photoshop so that the images
  are as true as they can be."
