  ***‘This is a landscape to be reckoned with. Treat it with respect but take
  all you can from it. Let it permeate every cell in your body and fill your
  spirit. Then hold on to it.***


  ***‘I try to convey a moment in a place that is changing all the time, the
  rain, snow, light, temperature, wind - giving their best and their worst,
  constantly transforming the landscape.***


  ***‘Invigorated and restored, I draw to remind, capture, convey, honour and
  record…’ CCS 2020***


  One could be forgiven for assuming Claire Christie Sadler to be English, and
  her husband Malcolm, Scottish, but it is actually the other way round…. At
  second glance, her hair and eye colour betray her. Born to Glaswegian Annie
  McQueen Christie, it is the West Coast of Scotland and the Western Isles that
  have captured both her heart and her imagination. CCS has spent the past
  fifteen years returning to Scotland several times a year to explore the
  Western Highlands, sometimes travelling with her husband, a committed Munro
  walker and hiker, and sometimes travelling alone.


  Artists are no strangers to solitude, but if you have walked The Highlands,
  you will know that they can be as fearsome as they are uplifting. CCS’s first
  solo foray, was as artist-in-residence to a remote Bothy towards St Finian’s
  Isle, Loch Shiel. With the raw basics of bed, desk, fire and paraffin lamp,
  Claire hunkered down with her dog for a week, her task to create a set of
  drawings inspired by the landscape around her. The nearest cottage was a mile
  away. CCS reluctantly admits to a newfound fear of the dark, but agreed that
  it was essentially a fear of ‘somebody’ in the dark, and not the night or the
  land itself. Loud noises against the outer walls in the pitch black turned out
  to be no more than red deer, perhaps scavenging for rich pickings. Quickly she
  resolved to tune in to daylight hours, turning in at dusk and rising at dawn.
  In contrast to unsettling nocturnal moments, CCS was exhilarated to be alone
  during the day, drawing energy from the dynamic of an ancient landscape than
  enveloped her.


  CCS’s drawings articulate a sense of nature at large that solitude in the wild
  affords – a landscape forged across millennia shaped by geology and the
  climate, our presence brief and insignificant, no more than a flicker of life
  against the scale of time. Her compositions, in graphite, conté pencil and
  charcoal on paper and drafting film, are therefore unpeopled. There are no
  trees. The weather forbids it. Light streams through shape-shifting clouds
  revealing mountains that fall into the sea lochs below. The magic of the
  landscape is brought to life by light and shadow - falling veils and showers
  in play with shafts and pools of sunlight. A spectrum of greys capture the
  changing moods that darken to charcoals and blacks, contrasting with
  highlights of radiant whites. For CCS, monochrome captures the poetry that is
  the landscape.


  As a consummate professional musician and cellist of decades, music like art
  defines her. She says quite simply ‘It is a part of me’, and when working from
  her studio in North Oxford, she plays a broad range of classical music,
  choosing as one would expect, specific recordings, conductors and performers –
  matching her choice to her mood from Bach to Britten, from Tallis to Taverner.
  Claire Christie Sadler’s drawings, like her music, are immaculately executed


  and beautifully expressed. There is a sense for her that art and music are
  indivisible one from the other, each driven by a passion that expresses a
  certain faith, or sense of oneness, that for many of us is the call of the
  wild.

  **Biography : Claire Christie Sadler….**


  ‘My initial training and work was as cellist, which I maintain. Perhaps the
  transient nature of musical performance is evident in my drawing and could
  also explain why I work with a keen awareness of the performative aspect of
  making art.


  Since gaining a BA Hons in Fine Art in 2004, I have exhibited nationally and
  locally, undertaken business and ecclesiastical commissions, led community art
  projects in the UK and Tamil Nadu, Indian (2010). I also teach experimental
  drawing at Oxford Summer School.’ CCS 2020


  Claire Christie Sadler lives and works from her studio in Oxford. Her dream is
  to live in The Highlands.

  Claire Christie Sadler 2016: “I sometimes think I am trying to draw silence”


  Claire Christie Sadler has spent 20 years perfecting the art of drawing. This
  exhibition celebrates her passion for the West Coast of Scotland – from
  Applecross to Raasay and Kkye, the Kyles of Bute, the Fairy Pools beneath the
  stark Black Cuillins – a particular wilderness where the landscape is
  constantly shifting as clouds drift across the mountains and ocean shoreline,
  pools of light glimmering momentarily through veils of shadow.


  Monochrome is a natural fit for this timeless landscape that stretches so far
  and forward of us, and complements Christie Sadler’s appetite for line and
  form. Her spectrum from white to black is myriad and lends weight to the
  contemplative sensibility that is a consequence of solitary hours spent at one
  with the natural world.


  Claire Christie Sadler trained in music as a cellist, performing and teaching,
  but ultimately found herself as drawn to art as to music. She has not put the
  bow down, but attended Foundation and thereafter a Fine Arts Degree over five
  years. For her, the act of music making and art are inextricably bound. The
  art of playing and drawing are for her hewn from the same bough and the
  intention with which she draws the bow across the strings or graphite across
  paper, informs that ‘mark’. She is captivated by the performative act of
  drawing.
