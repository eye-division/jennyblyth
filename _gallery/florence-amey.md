  **FLORENCE AMEY &nbsp;**


  ***Florence Amey : "I create abstract expressionist paintings because I find
  the creative process honest and satisfying.&nbsp; It is, for me, an intuitive
  exploration of vibrational marks, gestures, and most importantly colour, that
  expresses mood and movement.&nbsp; I enjoy painting in an unconscious way
  creating compositions that are expressive and dynamic, rather than originating
  motifs from observed objects. I find that painting without knowing the outcome
  emphasizes the spontaneity of the painting which keeps the images authentic
  and free. My aim is to capture ‘snapshots’ or ‘moments’ of when I am painting
  in this state of mind - an expression of core energy and zest for
  life.”&nbsp;***


  &nbsp;Florence Amey has a background in dance, and fenced at national level
  for years before committing to painting.&nbsp; Despite a classical training in
  Fine Art, her compositions are not tethered to literal figuration of objects
  or landscape. Her paintings are talkative, a moment's kaleidoscope on the
  page, morphing from one composition to another, to secure a tipping point of
  perfect balance.&nbsp; Layering appears to come easily, so that we are drawn
  through one portal to explore another.&nbsp; Her painting is truly abstract
  expressionist, articulating mood and movement.&nbsp; Colour is her voice - a
  jewelled colour spectrum of emotion that spans a *ph* from darker depths to a
  heightened sense of joy and liberation.


  &nbsp;Florence Amey embarked initially on a Fine Arts Degree at Bristol after
  a Foundation Year at Brighton City College, moving to Spain in 2011 where she
  completed a four year degree in Fine Art at the University of Seville. She
  returns to Britain after eight years in Andalucia. Florence now lives and
  works from her studio in Bath.&nbsp; Her workis rooted in the wild heart of
  Spanish flamenco.
