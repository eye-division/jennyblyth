  **FLORENCE AMEY &nbsp;**


  *"Whilst observation of the world is still central to my practice, my hope is
  that other frameworks are also influencing me.&nbsp; I've tried to make marks,
  colours, gestures and textures in an unconscious, intuitive way, rather than
  basing motifs on observed objects.&nbsp; My broad challenge is to make
  paintings that satisfy me.&nbsp; Ones that are expressive and dynamic, that
  are made in an almost meditative state of mind. For when painting in that
  "zone", invention truly starts and I am pleasantly surprised by what
  emerges."…. Florence Amey.*


  Florence Amey has recently returned to the UK from Spain where she lived for
  eight years. She is a Fine Arts Graduate from Seville University where she
  studied for four years. &nbsp;She spent one year at Bristol University after
  completing Foundation at Brighton City College.


  Florence Amey's paintings manifest an expression of core energy and zest for
  life.&nbsp; Her work is infused with the flavour of Spanish culture – with
  passion and rigour.&nbsp; Despite a classical training, her compositions are
  not tethered to landscape or literal figuration - her painting is truly
  abstract expressionist, articulating a bejewelled colour spectrum of emotion
  that spans a pH from darker depths to a sense of joy and liberation.&nbsp;
  Colour is her voice, but not at the expense of form.&nbsp; Layering appears to
  come easily, so that we are drawn through one portal to explore another.&nbsp;
  Her paintings shimmer, a moment's kaleidoscope on the page, morphing from one
  composition to another, a tipping point of perfect balance.&nbsp;&nbsp;
