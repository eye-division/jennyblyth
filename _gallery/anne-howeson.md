  **FEET OF ANGELS&nbsp; &nbsp;:&nbsp; &nbsp;ANNE HOWESON&nbsp; &nbsp; :
  &nbsp;****18 March – 29 April 2023**


  **CAREY BLYTH GALLERY : 8 Woodstock Road Oxford OX2 6HT**


  **Hours : Wed-Sat 12-5 pm**


  **Note : There will be two Talks.&nbsp; One with artist in conversation with
  Sacha Craddock, journalist & art critic, and one in conversation with Erika
  Lederman, V&A Women in Photography Specialist. Dates and times to be
  confirmed.**


  Drawing is often overlooked, presented as sketches for ‘finished’ work, a
  journey towards the myriad paintings or sculptures we enjoy.&nbsp; Rarely is
  it considered in its own right.&nbsp; But artists like William Kentridge have
  brought a whole new insight and appreciation to the fine art of drawing, and
  the different ways in which it can be expressed. Anne Howeson’s work is a
  truly contemporary representation of the medium. Observed with a mind fixed in
  politics, she reflects on the historical and the contemporary, noting
  intention and effect.&nbsp; Her desire to balance out fears for the future or
  the wrongdoings of the past, is manifest in an ethereal dimension that is
  apparent in her enjoyment of storytelling and imagination.


  **Feet of Angels** is a new body of work responding to the photography of
  William Henry Fox Talbot.&nbsp; It is accompanied by drawings from recent
  years that follow through from her last exhibition ‘**Present in the Past’,**
  in which she explored the transformation of Kings Cross over 300 years.&nbsp;
  Where previously she used 18th and 19th Century engravings, the new drawings
  are worked over Fox Talbot photographs from the Bodleian Libraries Collection,
  and their online Catalogue Raisonée.

  Howeson celebrates photography, but her work is infused with narrative and
  dreams, peopled with characters drawn from plays and poems, perhaps a figure
  she has encountered momentarily.&nbsp; Her chosen photograph may contain much,
  or little of note to anyone other than herself.&nbsp; It is a springboard to
  other worlds, for transcending time as she prepares to choreograph her
  dioramas.&nbsp; After scrubbing out selected original figures and features,
  Howeson introduces her own players, trees and greenery. &nbsp;Working in
  gouache, conté and crayon, she brings colour to the monochrome, accentuating
  light and dark. Chiaroscuro adds rigour to her tableaux, and the narrative
  unfurls as she introduces both period and contemporary characters to a
  re-orchestrated landscape.&nbsp; Her work is complex, whether pastoral and
  quiet, or politically charged and pithy, it is laced with moments from beyond
  with which she seeks to soften the grit of reality.&nbsp; The overall effect
  is unsettling, suggesting an unearthly presence.
