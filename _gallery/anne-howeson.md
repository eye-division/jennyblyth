  **FEET OF ANGELS : ANNE HOWESON :****18 March – 29 April 2023**


  **CAREY BLYTH GALLERY : 8 Woodstock Road Oxford OX2 6HT**


  **Hours : Wed-Sat 12-5 pm. Free.**


  **Note : There will be two Talks. One with artist in conversation with Sacha
  Craddock, journalist & art critic, and one in conversation with Erika
  Lederman, V&A, Women in Photography Specialist. Dates and times to be
  confirmed.**


  Drawing is often overlooked, presented as sketches for finished work, a
  journey towards the myriad paintings or sculptures we enjoy. Rarely is it
  considered in its own right. But artists like William Kentridge have brought a
  whole new insight and appreciation to the fine art of drawing, and the
  different ways in which it can be expressed. Anne Howeson’s work is a truly
  contemporary representation of the medium. Observed with a mind fixed in
  politics, she reflects on the historical and the contemporary, noting
  intention and effect. Her desire to balance out fears for the future or the
  wrongdoings of the past, is manifest in an ethereal dimension that is apparent
  in her enjoyment of storytelling and imagination.


  **Feet of Angels** is a new body of work responding to the photography of
  William Henry Fox Talbot. It is accompanied by drawings from recent years that
  follow through from her last exhibition **Present in the Past** in which she
  explored the transformation of Kings Cross over 300 years. Where previously
  she used 18th and 19th Century engravings, the new drawings are worked over
  Fox Talbot photographs from the Bodleian Libraries Collection, and their
  online Catalogue Raisonée.

  Howeson celebrates photography, but her work is infused with narrative and
  dreams, peopled with characters drawn from plays and poems, perhaps a figure
  she has encountered momentarily. Her chosen photograph may contain much, or
  little of note to anyone other than herself. It is a springboard to other
  worlds, for transcending time as she prepares to choreograph her dioramas.
  After scrubbing out selected original figures and features, Howeson introduces
  her own players, trees and greenery. Working in gouache, conté and crayon, she
  brings colour to the monochrome, accentuating light and dark. Chiaroscuro adds
  rigour to her tableaux, and the narrative unfurls as she introduces both
  period and contemporary characters to a re-orchestrated landscape. Her work is
  complex, whether pastoral and quiet, or politically charged and pithy, it is
  laced with moments from beyond with which she seeks to soften the grit of
  reality. The overall effect is unsettling, suggesting an unearthly presence.
