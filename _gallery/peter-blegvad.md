  ***‘ Feet, what do I need you for when I have wings to fly?* ’ Frida Kahlo**


  Peter Blegvad’s art is conceptual, nebulous, playful and quirky.&nbsp; It is
  challenging with much for the viewer to explore, and contemplave in the
  unravelling. There is an existenal element to his pracce that he has developed
  parallel to his media career since the ‘70s recorded in ***Imagine, Observe,
  Remember*** *(Uniformbooks 2020)* in which he examines askance the process of
  making art whilst reflecng to what extent art is based on the images retained
  in our mind’s eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;


  ‘***Blegvad’s kites are a new language for paintings-as-things (without being
  sculptures) or ‘constructions'.&nbsp; Just beautiful’*** **— Will Eaves**


  Preoccupaons and narrave are woven into Blegvad’s **‘Flightless Kites’** like
  dreams. Whether figurave or abstracted, they are suspended in a state of
  ‘meditave’ stasis.This series of 3D ‘construct painngs’ feature kites with
  wood infrastructure, rigged with string and overlaid with a film of ssue
  papiermȃché that lends a milky dreamlike sensibility. *Villard de*
  *Honnecourt,* a 13th Century French inerant arst, whose ‘sketchbook’ of
  annotated drawings revealed him to be both architect and engineer, is the
  subject of Blegvad’s ‘***De Honnecourt I & II’***. Depicted in medieval
  portraiture style but for the eyes, his gaze is fearful, all seeing above the
  city skyline.&nbsp; Archaic on first inspecon, the dis-ease reflects
  contemporary concerns.


  ***‘Delphic Dials’*** refers to the ambivalent predicons of Pythia.&nbsp;
  Presenng as the dashboard of a cargo cult plane, the arst challenges the
  parameters of what can be measured, predicted or controlled with a playfully
  complex ‘*Blue Peter’* construcon. Obscured gardening neng forms the
  groundwork for a tableau of ssue paper discs as funconal as communion wafers
  with satellite decal numerals that complete the ficon. All is carefully locked
  into place with varnish and glue. The arst has created a secret world,
  intricate and intensely worked like a hive of pollen, wax and honey.


  To complement his ***Flightless Kites***, Peter Blegvad is showing a porolio
  of drawings and painngs. Black and White Portraits in ink on paper of actors,
  musicians and arsts from 1920s, 30s and 40s draw on classic ‘film noir’ with
  beauful landscape painngs in acrylic on paper - a nod to Hokusai - delineated
  in simple lines and quiet palee that are decepvely calming.&nbsp; ***Cataract
  ***featuresa fast-flowing waterfall constrained by dark terrain that has the
  zen of symmetry, and ***Alp*** portrays a snow-capped mountain peak that
  beckons above a sheer and harsh ascent.


  As teacher and broadcaster of many years, illustrator, musician, songwriter,
  and author, it follows that Peter Blegvad creates a kaleidoscope of Art that
  reflects a lifeme of extraordinary creavity.&nbsp; Inving us to share his
  journey, his work is imbued with humour and intellect in equal measure.&nbsp;
