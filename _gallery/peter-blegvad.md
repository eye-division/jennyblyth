  ***‘ Feet, what do I need you for when I have wings to fly?* ’ Frida Kahlo**


  Peter Blegvad’s art is conceptual, nebulous, playful and quirky.&nbsp; It is
  challenging with much for the viewer to explore, and contemplative in the
  unravelling. There is an existential element to his practice that he has
  developed parallel to his media career since the ‘70s recorded in ***Imagine,
  Observe, Remember*** *(Uniformbooks 2020)* in which he examines askance the
  process of making art whilst reflecting to what extent art is based on the
  images retained in our mind’s eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;


  ‘***Blegvad’s kites are a new language for paintings-as-things (without being
  sculptures) or ‘constructions'.&nbsp; Just beautiful’*** **— Will Eaves**


  Preoccupations and narrative are woven into Blegvad’s **‘Flightless Kites’**
  like dreams. Whether figurative or abstracted, they are suspended in a state
  of ‘meditative’ stasis.This series of 3D ‘construct paintings’ feature kites
  with wood infrastructure, rigged with string and overlaid with a film of
  tissue papier-mȃché that lends a milky, dreamlike sensibility. *Villard de*
  *Honnecourt,* a 13th Century French itinerant artist, whose ‘sketchbook’ of
  annotated drawings revealed him to be both architect and engineer, is the
  subject of Blegvad’s ‘***De Honnecourt I & II’***. Depicted in medieval
  portraiture style but for the eyes, his gaze is fearful, all seeing above the
  city skyline.&nbsp; Archaic on first inspection, the dis-ease reflects
  contemporary concerns.


  ***‘Delphic Dials’*** refers to the ambivalent predictions of Pythia.&nbsp;
  Presenting as the dashboard of a cargo cult plane, the artist challenges the
  parameters of what can be measured, predicted or controlled with a playfully
  complex ‘*Blue Peter’* construction. Obscured gardening netting forms the
  groundwork for a tableau of tissue paper discs as functional as communion
  wafers with satellite decal numerals that complete the fiction. All is
  carefully locked into place with varnish and glue. The artist has created a
  secret world, intricate and intensely worked like a hive of pollen, wax and
  honey.


  To complement his ***Flightless Kites***, Peter Blegvad is showing a portfolio
  of drawings and paintings. Black and White Portraits in ink on paper of
  actors, musicians and artists from 1920s, 30s and 40s draw on classic ‘film
  noir’ with beautiful landscape paintings in acrylic on paper - a nod to
  Hokusai - delineated in simple lines and quiet palette that are deceptively
  calming.&nbsp; ***Cataract \*\**features a fast-flowing waterfall constrained
  by dark terrain that has the zen of symmetry, and \*\**Alp*** portrays a
  snow-capped mountain peak that beckons above a sheer and harsh ascent.


  As teacher and broadcaster of many years, illustrator, musician, songwriter,
  and author, it follows that Peter Blegvad creates a kaleidoscope of Art that
  reflects a lifetime of extraordinary creativity.&nbsp; Inviting us to share
  his journey, his work is imbued with humour and intellect in equal
  measure.&nbsp;
