  *"My inspiration comes from things observed although paint mostly from memory.
  I am interested in the evolving relationship between shape, colour and
  texture. I enjoy playing with the compositional and material elements of a
  painting until they resolve themselves in ways that are difficult to predict.
  The layers, the rhythm, the accident and the suggestion, all have their place.
  Each picture should become a visual poem.*


  *My father had a particular interest in archaeology so I grew up surrounded by
  interesting objects. I love what is often called "primitive" art for it simple
  eloquence and I am drawn to "Wabi Sabi" Japanese philosophy on the beauty in
  imperfection.”*


  Marie Boyle explores space, form and colour.&nbsp; Her muses are clear to see
  in William Scott, Barbara Hepworth and Ben Nicholson.&nbsp; Still life largely
  informs her practice enabling her ongoing play with abstraction where bottles
  and figures become interchangeable. Working from her studio in St Ives, the
  landscape of Cornwall is evident, pared back and simplified into blocks and
  bands of colour.


  Marie Boyle was born in France 1966.&nbsp; She studied graphic design in Paris
  (E.S.A.M). thereafter working in advertising before moving to Oxford.&nbsp;
  She took up painting under the tuition of Prue Pardue RA, and the St Ives
  School of Art. She has a strong interest in photography and ceramics and is a
  member of the OXFORD ART SOCIETY and associate member of the PENWITH GALLERY
  in St Ives. She lives and works in Oxford and St Ives where she has studios.
