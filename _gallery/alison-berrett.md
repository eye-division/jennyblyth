  **ALISON BERRETT**


  *‘My Bathybic Heart’*


  APRIL 2022 at Carey Blyth Gallery, Oxford


  ***‘I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tideIs a
  wild call and a clear call that may not be denied;And all I ask is a windy day
  with the white clouds flying,And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the
  sea-gulls crying’.***


  *‘Sea Fever’ by John Masefield (1878-1967*


  For so many of us, the sea calls and given long enough away, we experience a
  deep longing to be by the ocean. Such a creature is Alison Berrett finding
  inspiration where the ocean meets the land. Her paintings focus on the energy
  and dynamic of the sea at the point that it encounters the beach. Her seascape
  abstractions are emotive - ‘My Bathybic Heart’ - eliciting a spectrum of
  responses as waves curl and churn, rolling and roiling onto the shoreline,
  flooding into pools in swirling eddies around rocks, leaching between pebbles.
  Our senses are elevated by the movement, the foaming spume, the spectrum of
  blues from turquoise and lilac shallows to deep indigos. Smell and taste, the
  grit of sand and saltwater entwined with ribbons of seaweed, the endless
  rhythms of tides that pull and pool, the sounds of the ocean that liberate our
  souls taking us from a state of exhilaration to a meditative calm.


  Berrett’s paintings are Abstracted Expressionist, experiential for her, and
  for us as viewers. Painting the ocean over years has enabled her to perfect
  her alphabet and language of mark-making, allowing her to focus on the primal
  energy of the elements at a point of confluence. Transposing that to the land
  has been a natural consequence of a studio and home surrounded by open
  Oxfordshire farmland. Far from the coast, her attention has been drawn
  naturally to the dynamic of the landscape that surrounds her. It is easy to
  determine which of her paintings are sea-based and which are land-based, not
  solely from the palette but from the language that radiates from her
  compositions. Her landscapes are no less liberating and joyous than her
  seascapes as she delights in her ability to capture the relationship between
  the elements and their impact on her state of mind.


  Alison Berrett trained in Fine Art at Exeter College of Art and Design.
  Graduating in 1991, she completed her PGCE at Exeter University moving to
  Oxfordshire in 1994 where she maintained her teaching practice at Cheney
  School, working also as Art Therapist whilst *artist-in-residence* at The Art
  Room Oxford.


  Alison is now a full-time painter working from her studio at home in
  Oxfordshire.
