  Otmoor remains a 'place apart' – a quiet and fragile haven for marsh harriers,
  merlin and peregrine, owls, thousands of ducks, teal and widgeon, and
  murmurations of starling that coil and roll like polar bears in the winter
  skies.&nbsp; Andrew Walton moved as a child to Noke from the deprivation of
  post-war London to a wild wetland of reedbeds, meadows and birdsong.&nbsp;


  Recorded in the Domesday Book, Otmoor (Fen A Ota) provided grazing, hunting
  and foraging for all until Enclosure in 1815 which prompted the Otmoor Riots
  (1829-30). Today two thousand acres of marshland create a wilderness nature
  reserve - peripheral wooden walkways ensure an uninterrupted haven for the
  rhythms of nature that play out under high skies.&nbsp; In winter you hear
  only the breath of murmurations overhead and haunting calls of water
  birds.&nbsp;


  Walton’s ink drawings are distinct from his oils that capture full colour
  panoramic views of Otmoor from Beckley and Elsfield.&nbsp; His drawings in
  black and white are up-close and musical in sensibility, from the titles to
  the marks he makes on the page.&nbsp; ***Hog Hole*** &nbsp;is such a
  creature.&nbsp; One can hear the rough movement and snorting of the wild hog
  as he busies himself in mud amongst the reeds. &nbsp;


  Walton is fluent with different styles of painting that he selects to achieve
  his goal.&nbsp; He is master of paring down, so although at home with a
  contemporary, figurative landscape panning across the moor in oil on board, he
  shifts seamlessly to an abstracted translation at whim - celebrating the broad
  stretch of a generous horizon and the rustle of wind in reeds, in no more than
  a few lines, dots and scratches he creates wonderful minimalist paintings in
  ink on paper.

  > Andrew Walton: "I was born just after WW2. My parents had moved to Noke when
  they married in the early 1940s. We lived in a tiny cottage totally lacking
  modern amenities. No electricity, water from the well and an earth loo in 'The
  Elm Barn', a shed with a grand name, all set in a third of an acre of orchard.
  An artist’s retreat from the hurly burly of war torn London, this was my world
  - apple trees to climb, a stream to splash in, a duck pond beyond the gate
  where my brother and I launched catamaran boats whittled from elder sticks.
  The village was a place apart - a road petering out on the edge of the moor,
  smelling of cows and cow parsley, deep ditches fringed by pollarded willows,
  and a huge sky. This is the place my life started.”


  Andrew Walton has spent the past two years retracing the Moor of his childhood
  years. Otmoor remains a 'place apart'. Recorded in the Domesday Book, it is a
  wild and quiet refuge, a nature reserve with wooden walkways that ensure an
  uninterrupted haven for the rhythms of nature that play out under high skies -
  the breath of murmurations overhead, and haunting calls of water birds. A
  landscape of myth and wildness has been the impetus for Walton's paintings and
  poems by David Attwooll. 'Walking friends' of many years, painter and poet
  have created work that explores and celebrates an ancient landscape.


  Walton's work is playful. He is completely fluent in different styles of
  painting that he selects to achieve his goal. He is master of paring down, so
  although at home with a classically contemporary, figurative rendition of
  views across the moor in oil on board, he shifts seemlessly to an abstracted
  translation at whim, celebrating the broad stretch of a generous horizon and
  the rustle of wind in reeds, in no more than a few lines on flat fields of
  colour - minimalist paintings in oil on canvas.


  Walton's portfolio of Otmoor is a treasure trove. Capturing the ever-changing
  beauty of the moor, he pitches us from daylight to dusk in oils and
  watercolour, and across moonlit reeds hatched onto paper. He is as strong in
  monochrome as in high colour, articulate in abstraction as in figuration, a
  truly gifted and inquisitive artist with his heart immersed in landscape…
