  **NETTA CAREY :&nbsp; 8 Woodstock Road Oxford OX2 6HT**


  ***NC*** *\: "I was lucky enough to receive a formal training in art and
  design and the lessons I learned then are a fundamental part of my work to
  this day. A working study of composition, drawing from life, daily for months
  at a time, and an understanding of colour both in terms of design and
  energetic connection, are an essential part of who I am. I paint now from
  photographs that I abstract to form images, or simply from instinct.&nbsp; In
  essence I try to capture a moment in time that resonates for longer than the
  moment that it takes to see it.”*


  Essentially **Netta Carey** is a colourfield painter.&nbsp; Her muses are
  clear to see – Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman, Clifford Stills…. These artists
  emerged in New York in the 1950s and 60s distinct from the abstract
  expressionists such as Jackson Pollock who were more gestural and spontaneous
  in their painting.&nbsp; Quiet and contemplative, colourfield developed into
  an abstracted genre where ultimately colour reigned supreme and the viewer was
  transported to a meditative state of transcendence.&nbsp; Such a painting is
  ***I Must Be Dreaming*** where a spectrum of reds from crimsons and scarlets,
  to cardinal reds and burgundies, reflect the nuances and inflections of
  dreaming.


  *\*\*Nothing Is Ever Forever - \*\**essentially a Still Life with objects
  scattered and milk spilt, conveys a sense of ambivalence and transcience
  whilst celebrating a fiesta of warm tones and clear palette that is both
  seductive and refreshing. Netta’s passion for abstraction and colourfield is
  full of heart.


  In ***Back To The Wild,* Netta Carey** explores the landscape and spirit of
  the Scottish Highlands at Alladale where Paul Lister has over the past 16
  years created a rewilding project.&nbsp; Lister’s intention is to return the
  23,000 acre estate to a natural woodland haven for wildlife, to include
  wolves, bears and lynx.&nbsp; Carey’s paintings capture the wild heart of
  Scotland where scale is untamed by the absence of human intrusion.
  &nbsp;Particularly she captures the quiet strength and beauty of Alladale in
  all its autumn richness - purple skies echo the heather above russet-red
  bracken stretching across her canvases in bands of colour.&nbsp; Lochs gleam
  across a spectrum of white.&nbsp;


  **Netta Carey** trained at the Paris American Academy (1982-83), London
  College of Printing (1984-87), Chelsea School of Art (1983-84) and L’Ecole Des
  Beaux Artes, Nantes (1986).&nbsp; She lives and works in Oxfordshire and
  Snowdonia where she has studios. Her work is placed in private collections in
  UK, France and USA.

  Carey’s paintings capture the wild heart of Scotland, particularly the quiet
  strength and beauty of Alladale in all its richness.&nbsp; Transposing the
  deep purple of heather to the skies and stretching the russet-red bracken
  across her canvases, scale is undiminished by the absecse of human
  intervention. Carey abstracts the landscape into bands of colour. Our eye
  delights in the colourfield quickly unravelling the composition into landscape
  where the lochs gleam and glisten in a spectrum of whites between the
  shorelines under a thunderous sky.
