  *[…](/)"I was lucky enough to receive a formal training in art and design and
  the lessons I learnt then are a fundamental part of my work to this day. A
  working study of composition, drawing from life - often for months at a time,
  day in and day out - and an understanding of colour both in terms of design
  and energetic connection - are an essential part of who I am. I paint now from
  photographs that I abstract to form images, or simply from instinct - in
  essence I try to capture a moment in time that resonates for longer than the
  moment that it takes to see it.*


  Netta Carey explores the landscape and spirit of the Scottish Highlands at
  Alladale where Paul Lister has over the past 16 years created a rewilding
  project.&nbsp; Lister’s intention is to return the 23,000 acre estate to a
  natural wooded haven for wildlife, to include wolves, bears and lynx.&nbsp;
  Carey’s paintings capture the wild heart of Scotland, particularly the quiet
  strength and beauty of Alladale in all its richness where deep purple heather
  and russet-red bracken stretch across her canvases in bands of autumnal
  colours, and scale is undiminished by the absence of human habitation.


  Netta Carey trained at the Paris American Academy (1982-83), London College of
  Printing (1984-87), Chelsea School of Art (1983-84) and L’Ecole Des Beaux
  Artes, Nantes (1986).&nbsp; She lives and works in Oxfordshire and Snowdonia
  where she has studios.
