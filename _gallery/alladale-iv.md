  *[…](/)"I was lucky enough to receive a formal training in art and design and
  the lessons I learnt then are a fundamental part of my work to this day. A
  working study of composition, drawing from life - often for months at a time,
  day in and day out - and an understanding of colour both in terms of design
  and energetic connection - are an essential part of who I am. I paint now from
  photographs that I abstract to form images, or simply from instinct - in
  essence I try to capture a moment in time that resonates for longer than the
  moment that it takes to see it.*


  Netta Carey explores the landscape and spirit of the Scottish Highlands at
  Alladale where Paul Lister has over the past 16 years created a rewilding
  project.&nbsp; Lister’s intention has been to return the 23,000 acre estate to
  a natural wooded haven for wildlife.&nbsp;


  Carey’s paintings capture the wild heart of Scotland, particularly the quiet
  strength and beauty of Alladale in all its richness. Transposing the deep
  purple of heather to the skies and stretching the russet-red bracken across
  her canvases, scale is undiminished by the absence of human
  intervention.&nbsp; Carey abstracts the landscape into bands of colour.&nbsp;
  Our eye delights, quickly translating her colourfield composition to landscape
  where&nbsp; lochs gleam and glisten in a spectrum of whites under a thunderous
  sky.


  Netta Carey trained at the Paris American Academy (1982-83), London College of
  Printing (1984-87), Chelsea School of Art (1983-84) and L’Ecole Des Beaux
  Artes, Nantes (1986).&nbsp; She lives and works in Oxfordshire and Snowdonia
  where she has studios.
