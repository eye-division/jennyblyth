  ***NETTA CAREY Mirror, Mirror*** *oil on canvas 98 x 125 cm*


  ***NC*** *\: "I was lucky enough to receive a formal training in art and
  design and the lessons I learned then are a fundamental part of my work to
  this day. A working study of composition, drawing from life, daily for months
  at a time, and an understanding of colour both in terms of design and
  energetic connection, are an essential part of who I am.&nbsp; In essence I
  try to capture a moment in time that resonates for longer than the moment that
  it takes to see it.”*


  Essentially **Netta Carey** is a colourfield painter.&nbsp; Her muses are
  clear to see – Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman, Helen Frankenhaler ……These artists
  emerged in New York in the 1940s and 50s distinct from the Abstract
  Expressionists such as Jackson Pollock who were more gestural and spontaneous
  in their painting.&nbsp; Quiet and contemplative, colourfield developed into
  an abstracted genre where ultimately colour reigned supreme and the viewer was
  transported to a meditative state of transcendence.&nbsp;


  ***Mirror, Mirror*** focusses on form as much as colour with shapes
  juxtapositioned within the frame of the composition challenging us to explore
  and enquire.&nbsp; Netta’s palette is exquisite.&nbsp; She has a profound
  understanding of colour – note how the light in the reds are set off by the
  deep indigo blue.


  In ***Back To The Wild, &nbsp;***shown here at CBG last year, Nettaexplored
  the landscape and spirit of the Scottish Highlands at Alladale where Paul
  Lister over the 16 years created a rewilding project.&nbsp; Lister’s intention
  is to return the 23,000 acre estate to a natural woodland haven for wildlife,
  to include wolves, bears and lynx.&nbsp; Carey’s paintings captured the wild
  heart of Scotland where the landscape is untamed by the absence of human
  intrusion.&nbsp; Particularly she captured the quiet strength and beauty of
  Alladale in all its autumn richness - purple skies echoed the heather above
  russet-red bracken stretching across her canvases in bands of colour.&nbsp;
  Lochs gleamed across a spectrum of white.&nbsp; The exhibition sold out.


  **Netta Carey** trained at the Paris American Academy (1982-83), London
  College of Printing (1984-87), Chelsea School of Art (1983-84) and L’Ecole Des
  Beaux Artes, Nantes (1986).&nbsp; She lives and works in Oxfordshire and
  Snowdonia where she has studios. Her work is placed in private collections in
  UK, France and USA.

  *"I was lucky enough to receive a formal training in art and design and the
  lessons I learnt then are a fundamental part of my work to this day. A working
  study of composition, drawing from life - often for months at a time, day in
  and day out - and an understanding of colour both in terms of design and
  energetic connection - are an essential part of who I am. I paint now from
  photographs that I abstract to form images, or simply from instinct - in
  essence I try to capture a moment in time that resonates for longer than the

  Netta Carey explores the landscape and spirit of the Scottish Highlands at
  Alladale where Paul Lister has over the past 16 years created a rewilding
  project.&nbsp; Lister’s intention has been to return the 23,000 acre estate to
  a natural wooded haven for wildlife.&nbsp;


  Carey’s paintings capture the wild heart of Scotland, particularly the quiet
  strength and beauty of Alladale in all its richness.&nbsp; Transposing the
  deep purple of heather to the skies and stretching the russet-red bracken
  across her canvases, scale is undiminished by the absecse of human
  intervention. Carey abstracts the landscape into bands of colour. Our eye
  delights in the colourfield quickly unravelling the composition into landscape
  where the lochs gleam and glisten in a spectrum of whites between the
  shorelines under a thunderous sky.
