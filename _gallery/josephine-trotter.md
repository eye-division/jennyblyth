  "Josephine Trotter lives at one with the landscape that surrounds her in the
  Oxfordshire hills. Her home exudes an atmosphere of wellbeing, warmth, nature
  and art that spills over into the celebration of life that makes her paintings
  so distinctive. For the last two years, landscape has engaged her most
  although throughout her long career she has also painted still-lifes and
  portraits. She has often travelled to paint in sunnier spots, Greece, Turkey,
  Italy and France, but now it is in the landscapes of Britain that she finds
  her inspiration, especially in their wonderful variety of greens.


  In *Brailes Hill in May*, 2015 (fig.00) expanses of brilliant yellow rape glow
  against the fresh spring green fields striped with pink furrows, sparkling in
  the early summer sunshine. Hills fold into each other, pile up against the sky
  and culminate in the distinctive profile of Brailles Hill, a local landmark.
  The sense of rapture that this work conveys is at the heart of all Trotter’s
  work and is expressed, above all, through radiant colour.


  Trotter’s gift for distilling in her paintings that first ecstatic response to
  a scene brings to mind Van Gogh, an artist she admires. Like Van Gogh, she
  reacts immediately and powerfully to a motif that she finds compelling. ‘I get
  an absolute bolt in the head’, she explains, adding ‘I can’t explain it – it’s
  very powerful.’ Away from home, in Cumbria or Wales, she begins by ‘mapping’
  her territory by driving around a region to survey the landscape until she is
  seized by a particular view. Like Van Gogh, she paints *en plein air* in a
  single creative burst, usually finishing a painting in one day. The early
  morning light determines the feel of a painting. She dislikes the ‘flattening
  light’ of midday and as the sun moves across her subject throughout the day,
  rather than adjusting the tones of her composition to the shifting conditions,
  she remains true to that first light that ignited her imagination. She does no
  preparatory sketches and never relies on photographs, but draws the broad
  outlines of the composition with a brush loaded with thinly diluted paint.
  Once a painting is finished, she never revises in the studio. This truth to
  nature is often physically challenging. Like Monet struggling with the weather
  on the beaches of Normandy, or Van Gogh with the Mistral in Provence, Trotter
  sometimes has to weight her easel with bags of stones to stop high winds
  carrying her canvas away.


  As with Van Gogh, the spontaneity of Trotter’s work belies the thought and the
  thorough grounding in technique that lie behind it. She may paint quickly but
  there is no doubt that an innate sense of organisation and structure
  contribute to the force of her paintings. Her pigments, she explains, are
  always arranged in the same sequence on her palette and this helps her
  organise colour relationships on the canvas. And, like C&eacute;zanne, she
  builds up her composition across the canvas as a whole, constantly aware of
  how each part relates to the whole.


  A love of landscape was instilled in Trotter from the very beginning of her
  career. As a teenager, she took private lessons with the painter Maurice
  Field, a teacher at the Slade and who encouraged his students to paint in the
  open air and to record their observation with direct sincerity. He took her
  sketching in the footsteps of Constable on Hampstead Heath and introduced her
  to the artist’s oil sketches in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Drawing
  classes with the distinguished post-war artist Euan Uglow at St. Alban’s
  School of Art gave her a thorough grounding in draughtsmanship and pictorial
  structure. At Chelsea School of Art Trotter deepened her understanding of
  drawing by attending life classes for two hours every evening, a discipline
  that would have a lasting impact on her technique and her approach. Today, she
  often sees the swells and hollows of the landscape in terms of the human
  figure. But, most importantly, at Chelsea she also discovered colour. New
  paint ranges in tubes offered exhilarating possibilities – ‘at least five
  different greens’. ‘Colour came bursting out of me’, she recalls, and before
  long a brilliant rush of colour banished the muted palette of her earlier
  work.


  Not surprisingly, it was in the early twentieth-century colourists, Matisse,
  Derain and the Fauves that Trotter found her artistic mentors. And it is
  perhaps in her still-lifes that Trotter is closest to the Fauves. In *Red,
  Yellow and White Tulips with Red Jug,* 2014 (cat. 00), the brilliant flowers
  stand out against and at the same time intertwine with the patterned
  background. Trotter likes tulips for the way ‘they walk about’ freely on the
  end of their stems.


  She also learned from artists who emphasized the underlying structure of a
  composition, Georges Braque or Juan Gris, and especially C&eacute;zanne whose
  drawings she studied at the British Museum and who is still the artist whom
  perhaps she admires the most. Certainly, an innate structure in her own
  compositions grounds and balances the vivid colour and the emotional
  immediacy.


  Portraits have always engaged Trotter and remain important. Recently, in
  addition to her family, she has painted with great sympathy a full-bodied
  professional model, Christine, resplendently naked on a chaise-longue (cat.
  00), and Polly, the proprietor of a local bookshop who is celebrated for her
  colourful attire, in characteristic bright pink stockings and red shoes (cat,
  *The Blue Howgills, Cumbria,* 2015, cat. 00).


  But it is above all in landscape that Trotter has immersed herself in her
  recent work. She returns again and again to the benign, rolling countryside
  that surrounds her Oxfordshire home. While this particular landscape is
  fundamental to her current work, she has also explored more dramatic
  landscapes in Yorkshire, Wales, Yorkshire and Cumbria. During an expedition to
  Cumbria in the summer of 2015, she was captivated by the Blue Howgills hills,
  the rise and fall, the sweep and bend, the fluid shapes of the hills rushing
  up to the sky – Gerard Manley Hopkins’s line ‘Landscape plotted and pieced —
  fold, fallow, and plough’ (*Pied Beauty,* 1877) comes to mind – checked at the
  top of canvas by the deep blue band of the horizon (cat. 00).


  In *The Churchyard with Memorial, Betts Newydd* (cat. 00) Trotter tackles
  another subject close to her heart - graveyards. She insists that the subject
  has no metaphysical or spiritual significance for her but that the appeal is
  purely visual the strong, geometric forms of the crosses thrusting up through
  the loose, burgeoning green grass is what attracts her.


  Trotter’s latest work shows her at the height of her powers. She is an artist
  rooted in the tradition of modern Post-Impressionist painting but her deeply
  felt, poetic response to her native landscape brings a strong and totally
  individual vision to her subjects. She is a superlative painter in the truest
  sense of the word. ‘I absolutely love putting paint on’, she declares, ‘I love
  paint, the smell of paint and its texture.’ In the end, her art is about the
  stuff of painting, and it is in the visceral essence of the material itself
  that she has always found herself and the reason why her paintings speak so
  vividly to us.

  author of ‘*The Yellow House* and *The Man in The Blue Scarf* writes**


  June 2011:


  On June 27 1888, Vincent van Gogh wrote to his friend Emile Bernard,
  mentioning a new picture he had just done of the fields outside Arles. He
  called it Summer Evening and painted it, he explained, at a single sitting. To
  rework it was impossible “You see, I went out to do it expressly while the
  mistral was raging. Aren't we seeking intensity of thought rather than
  tranquillity of touch?” Josephine Trotter would no doubt understand exactly
  what he meant by that. “I’m a very immediate person”, she says, “so I have to
  have the hype of the subject in front of me”.


  A great admirer of Van Gogh, she herself has worked very close to his artistic
  territory. Last summer she painted below Les Baux de Provence, which is
  perched on top of Les Alpilles, the blue ridge of which can be seen in the
  background of so many of his Arles landscapes. In fact, she had a thoroughly
  Van Goghian experience there. “There was a mistral blowing and you could feel
  that rage and madness he got into because of this awful hot wind. It does make
  you feel mad. This painting blew away six times, it was very, very daunting. I
  had to go back when it had calmed down a bit.”


  A shared appreciation of the upside of that maddening wind is by no means the
  only attitude that Josephine Trotter shares with the great Dutch artist. She
  too is fond of onions, for example (Vincent was prone to pop them into
  pictures including Vincent’s Chair (1888), in which a boxful are sprouting in
  the background). Trotter “There’s something about onions. It’s the shape and
  the colour: all those different greens and the limes.” Another enthusiasm is
  irises, which swirl in the foreground of Cuq en Terasses, France (2010). “I’m
  so madly in love with Irises because I keep thinking about those Van Gogh
  Irises (1889)”. Above all, like Vincent, she is an artist who has a powerful
  feeling for the material she uses: oil paint, in all its glorious, glutinous
  physicality. “I get so excited about paint. During my progress as a painter I
  have become increasingly fascinated by its quality and application – from
  Cezanne’s architectural and controlled brush-strokes to the passion of Van
  Gogh’s.” Oil is her preferred medium; for works on paper she uses gouache
  rather than watercolour because it has more substance. If a feeling for the
  substantiality of pigment itself is one affinity that Trotter feels with Van
  Gogh, another is the emphasis she puts on drawing. Of course, the two are not
  easily separated, certainly not in Trotter’s case. “I feel privileged to have
  trained at a time when drawing was the crux and bones of art education and
  very hard work”.


  She was born in 1940, began paint as a child, and was taught life drawing by
  Maurice Feild before going on to art school. “When I was at Chelsea School of
  Art, I was taught to draw, draw, draw. We had life-drawing every night for two
  hours, and the same pose for a week.” Another piece of luck, in her view, was
  to have been taught by the late Euan Uglow, one of the most gifted British
  painters and draughtsmen of the post war period.


  From this intensive grounding in drawing from life, she emerged with a feeling
  for landscape that is grounded in human anatomy. “I think there’s a lot of
  drawing and tension in landscape. I think of my paintings of countryside as
  rather large nudes, like my model Christine. The contours of the hills give me
  the same feeling. If you don’t get the fields in right it’s the same as if you
  don’t get the arm in right. The whole thing falls apart”.


  In Trotter’s landscapes, such as Towards Buttermilk, Oxon (2010) you can sense
  that attitude towards topography – regarding it as an organism, tautly
  constructed of muscles, bones and sinews. Though this may seem a strange way
  to think about fields and hills, it is by no means unique. Degas, an artist
  who spent most of his time painting and drawing human bodies, once produced a
  picture that is simultaneously a coastal view and a reclining female nude, her
  limbs formed from the mounds of cliff-side turf.


  Degas, however, was – in one of the classifications of artists largely
  neglected by art historians – an indoor painter. All his work was done in the
  studio. Trotter on the other hand, in common with Van Gogh and Monet,
  predominately an outdoors artist. “I can’t finish my landscapes in the studio,
  when I come back I never touch them ever.”


  A battering from wind is only one of the hazards suffered by a painter working
  out of doors, sur le motif as artists used to put it in 19th century France –
  though it is one of the worst because a canvas is of course, a small sail,
  easily blown over or even away (Van Gogh advised tethering one’s easel to the
  ground with ropes and tent pegs during the mistral).


  Especially for a painter like Trotter who is “mad about English landscapes”
  there is the problem of rain, a great deal of which fell while she was
  painting Waterloo Bridge. In the South of France, where she painted last year,
  there is the question of heat. In one case, she had to come back and finish a
  painting at 6.30 in the morning, “because it was just too hot where I was
  sitting later in the day”.


  In busy places such as the centre of London, where Trotter painted the
  splendid sequence of paintings of bridges over the Thames, which is the
  centre-piece of this exhibition, there is the distraction of milling crowds of
  curious strangers. Van Gogh put up with that too, painting the Night Cafe
  (1888) on an easel set up in an all-night bar, much to the interest and
  amusement of the clientele.


  Trotter’s London and Tower Bridges from the Millennium Bridge (2010) was done
  sur le motif on one of the most teeming thoroughfares in the metropolis. In
  this case her husband claims some credit for its successful completion. “Angus
  feels he was very important in these pictures, which he was. He was whopping
  all the tourists away with an umbrella. They were like ants. We were there for
  seven hours. Angus said to me, “You are so rude!” I explained, “If I talk to
  anybody, I’d never paint, I have to be so focussed”. If anybody stuck their
  face in mine I just said I was foreign”.


  When painting the semi-castellated Victorian magnificence of Albert Bridge she
  managed to find a more secluded vantage-point, as she explains: “I’m used to
  having people breathing down my neck but it’s a relief to escape from them. I
  was so relieved that I could get into Battersea Park, climb over some iron
  railings, and sit in some gorse bushes.”


  The tricky thing with Lambeth Bridge was gaining access to the pontoon outside
  Tate Britain, from which it was painted. “I was so frustrated because I got
  there at quarter past 8 in the morning but they didn’t unlock the chain on the
  gate until about quarter past 11, waiting for the first ferry, by which time I
  was having a seizure”.


  Trotter’s set of London bridges is not a topographical exercise. It was
  undertaken out of affection for certain structures – starting with Battersea
  Bridge, which the painter knew from art school days. It is not, and is not
  intended to be, complete. Chelsea Bridge for example, was omitted. She went
  and looked at it, “I didn’t like it at all, it’s very flat and boring.”


  There are of course, ample precedents for painting London’s bridges – there’s
  a Thames-scape tradition that goes back to Canaletto in the 18th century, and
  includes Turner, Constable, Whistler and Monet. Trotter was especially
  conscious of Andr&eacute; Derain, whose vivacious fauvist London paintings she
  saw in a remarkable exhibition at the Courtauld Gallery in 2005-6. “I got very
  emotional about painting Tower Bridge thinking about Derain and those
  wonderful Thames pictures he did.”


  Tower Bridge at Night, her own Thames nocturne, however, is the picture that
  reached limits of painting sur le motif. A difficulty of painting outside
  anyway, especially in a country with rapidly fluctuating cloud-cover such as
  Britain, is the changing light. But what to do when the light goes altogether
  - that is at night? With the fading of light colour too disappears. For this
  Trotter explains. “I did some drawings and a little photograph but there were
  technical problems, I had to rush back and do it inside”. Nonetheless it is
  one of the most striking of her bridge paintings.


  Indeed, Trotter loves painting inside too. Early in 2010 she and her husband
  were snowed in at their Oxfordshire farm. “It was wonderful, I can’t tell you
  how wonderful. Nobody could get at you.” As she emphasises, inside or out,
  “The thing is, I really love painting.” That is abundantly evident from her
  exuberant work.


  **William Packer, artist and critic with Financial Times for 20 years**


  May 2006


  Josephine Trotter studied painting at St. Alban’s and then at Chelsea having
  previously been taught privately by Professor Maurice Feild of the Slade. She
  has sustained the commitment to painting she picked up so early, not only from
  him, but variously from such remarkable and demanding artists as Euan Uglow,
  Ceri Richards and Norman Adams, over what is now a long career. But
  commitment, as it was indeed for them, must always be something rather more
  than the simple combination of application and enthusiasm with which it may so
  easily be confused, no matter how sincerely professed. Enthusiasm is all very
  well, but, far beyond the immediate exercise, there must be to it too an
  intensity of focus that amounts to passion, and a persistence in taking the
  work through to a full realisation, if it is to carry with it any true
  purpose. Painting passionately is serious business. And Trotter is as serious
  as she is passionate a painter in just such a sense.


  She also remains as transparently enthusiastic as ever she was, and the
  physical pleasure she takes in the stuff of paint and the act of painting is
  manifest in everything she does. If anything, it has grown more evident as the
  years have gone on, her work of more recent years now full of a
  post-impressionist, fauvist energy, redolent of the artists she has come
  variously to admire so much – Matisse, Derain and Cezanne, Ivon Hitchens and
  Paul Nash. The paint is rich on the surface, the palette now clean and bright,
  the brush-stroke direct and confident, the structure always strong, clear and
  simple. And the work is full, too, of no less direct a delight in the chosen
  subject, whether it is the rich domestic landscape of the Cotswolds, the
  grander sweep of the Yorkshire moors, or hedonistic, sun-lit Italy. Here we
  have an artist fully in command of her material and technique, as sure of her
  subject as she is sure of her expressive means, and happy enough to continue
  as she is, set so easily and confidently in her ways.


  Yet clearly she is not so easily seduced. Though so open a pleasure is taken
  in the work in all its aspects, mere pleasurable self-expression is never its
  point. It is only the amateur that expects to enjoy himself, and Trotter knows
  full well, from long experience, that for all its joys, painting is never fun.
  And she knows too that the passion that informs it, like painting itself, is a
  contradiction and a mystery to be confronted, tested and disciplined rather
  than indulged – unfashionable demands that they are, perhaps, in our
  self-indulgent age. Her paintings may look, therefore, direct and simple in
  the statement, the product of an hour or two spent in easy, happy
  circumstances, but they are underpinned by disciplines long studied and hard
  won – disciplines of close observation, organisation and technical address, of
  light, space and form. It is a truism of art-commentary that all artists end
  up painting the same picture, for all the apparent changes of manner and
  subject over the years – *plus ca change* …. But it is, after all, in the
  nature of the truism to contain at least a germ of truth. My own belief, born
  of frequent experience, is that a true artist’s work does indeed tend to hang
  together in the end, all of a piece. And to see these recent paintings is not
  so much to wonder as to anticipate what a Trotter retrospective might tell us
  of the evolution of her work over her prolific career, and how it comes back
  in its essentials to itself.


  For here still are the landscapes and the interiors that preoccupied her in
  her student years. The tone may have been pitched so much lower, and the
  palette so much quieter than today, and there have been intermediate stages
  along the way, but the sense of an ordered, architectural and inhabited space,
  though now more often inhabited only by implication, is as strong as ever. The
  journey from those grey London roofs outside the studio window to the vibrant
  Manorbier Castle or the church at Cetinale is perhaps not all that far.


  Just so, she takes as her subjects just what has come to be familiar to her,
  whether everyday and close to home in Oxfordshire or what has become so on her
  travels, for she returns repeatedly to anywhere or anything she finds
  especially stimulating or intriguing – to the Papal house and its garden at
  Cetinale near Siena, both inside and out; to the great castles of Wales and
  England, those vast sculptures in the landscape, Harlech and Manorbier; to the
  Dorset coast at Bridport and Abbotsbury; to the Yorkshire moors and the Welsh
  mountains, both north and south. But, as with Chesterton’s ‘Manalive’, we
  travel far, perhaps, only in order to come home again. And Trotter is no more
  at home, and no more herself, than when working in her beloved Cotswolds,
  painting the local fields and farms, and the rise of Brailes Hill that she
  sees every day.


  While she expresses herself so truly and unaffectedly in all this work, the
  paradox is that self-expression has little to do with it. For self-expression,
  in art of any kind, self-consciously undertaken, is ever a snare and a
  delusion – and an irrelevant delusion too, for the simple reason that we
  express ourselves in any case in everything we do. Rather it is that, as for
  all artists, for her the difficulty and the eternal fascination lie in the
  struggle to get it right, of course in terms set by the artist’s own interests
  and intentions, but only so that the work can then be set free in the world to
  be taken as it is, standing as it were on its own feet. In even trying to get
  it right, all true artists do more than they know, and we come to their work
  not to be creatures of what they think, but to discover what it means to us,
  and tells us of what and where we are in the world. Josephine Trotter gets it
  right enough, and we are surprised and engaged by it, and better, for it\_.
