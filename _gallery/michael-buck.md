  **MICHAEL BUCK&nbsp;**


  ***‘A LIFE IN THE LANDSCAPE’***&nbsp; &nbsp;:&nbsp; 1 March - 1 April
  2022&nbsp;


  **Carey Blyth Gallery, Oxford**


  ***‘What is work for? - If it is to get the job done,***


  ***then indeed get a chain saw.&nbsp;***


  ***If, however, it is to connect with Nature &nbsp;***


  ***\- to know the tree and the rhythms it asks of our bodies -***


  ***then let’s use our hands, our arms, our feet, our lungs.&nbsp;***


  ***You work that you may keep pace with the Earth,&nbsp;***


  ***and the Soul of the Earth.’**&nbsp; &nbsp;*Michael Buck 2022


  ***‘For to be idle, is to become a stranger to the Seasons.***


  ***When you work, you are a flute through whose heart,***


  ***the whispering of the hours turns to music.’ &nbsp;**&nbsp;*Kahlil Gibran,
  The Prophet, 1922


  Michael Buck trained in Fine Art at The Ruskin School of Art, Oxford
  (1975-78).&nbsp; He is a painter of many years, but also an ecologist, and
  *‘green’* is at the heart of the matter for him as both artist and
  farmer.&nbsp; The two are inextricably linked with one discipline feeding the
  other.&nbsp; With mornings spent in the studio, and afternoons on the land, he
  is creater of cob houses from earth, clay and wood; hazel coppice and fencing;
  raising geese and cattle. Michael Buck’sart is in the living.&nbsp; It is both
  authentic and organic in spirit and essence, so that each day, he is at one
  with the elements and the rhythms of the earth - ***A Life Lived in the
  Landscape.***


  This collection of paintings provides an insight into his world:
  &nbsp;thunderous gun metal sky over sunlight grasses whilst scything the hay
  on The Green; trees bare in winter against a muddy sky towards Wytham; the
  changing contours of the land and the quiet of horses on Port Meadow, their
  tails skirting around their legs in the wind.


  Larger work celebrates the aerobatics of a cloud of crows, black above quilted
  Spring fields and hedgerows in greens, soft in the morning mist.&nbsp; Small
  works are painterly and fluent, vignettes of older times observed and captured
  ‘*en plein air’.* Michael Buck makes a stand for a return to synchronicity, a
  life truly lived in the landscape, at one with the natural world.
