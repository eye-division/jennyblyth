  **EARTH & ANGELS** at 30 Fenchurch Street, Bishopsgate, City of London EC3
  until 14 February 2025. EARTH : Paintings by Day Bowman. ANGELS : Paintings
  and Drawings by Gerry Judah. Curated by Jenny Blyth for Brookfield Properties.


  Gerry Judah trained at Goldsmiths’ graduating with an MA from The Slade. 
  Primary years lived in India before moving to London in the 1960s have had a
  lifelong impact on his perception of the world. The ornate architecture and
  rituals of temples, mosques, and synagogues infuse his work. *Crusaders I, II
  & III* are on permanent exhibition at *St. Paul’s Cathedral* and the *Imperial
  War Museum of the North*. Selected as one of the *Best of Young British
  Sculptors* at Whitechapel Gallery, Judah stepped across into Production
  Design, where he created sets for film, opera, and dance for more than twenty
  years. He has worked with Tarkovsky, David Bailey, and Ridley Scott, and
  continues to create the signature sculpture for Goodwood’s annual Festival of
  Speed.


  Faith, conflict and climate change have been at the heart of Judah’s work
  since his return to Fine Art fifteen years ago. His 3D white-on-white
  **Angels**, which document the devastation of war and the ravages to the Earth
  of climate change, have been shown internationally in museums and galleries
  with paintings and sculpture placed in public and private collections
  worldwide.


  **Gerry JUDAH at Carey Blyth Gallery, Oxford :** October 2021


  The breadth of Judah’s works reflects his personal journey with references to
  the country and city of his early years, Kolkata, and the changes demanded of
  a country blasted into the 21st Century, that remains firmly steeped in
  cultural and religious traditions that colour the everyday, the lives of its
  people, the cities and the landscape.


  *Drawings and Sculptures in **Past and Forward**. Monochrome impasto oil
  pastels manifest as **Ark Angels** - stellar trees, both rigorous and
  beautiful. Judah's sculptures are constructs from clouds to temples mounted
  onto rickshaws. The engineering is patently hand worked with bindings in steel
  and bamboo confirming a tradition of making anything and fixing everything.
  Explosively polarised, as with all Judah’s work, they encompass both **Past
  and Forward,** with references past to the beginnings of time, to the Tree of
  Life, and forward infused with inferences that arise from climate change and
  conflict.*


  Judah’s work provides a portal into his perceptions of the changing world.
  History, politics and environment pervade his compositions. Commissioned by
  Christian Aid to reflect on issues around the impact of modernity in his home
  country of Bengal, Judah’s work encompasses an ancient and thriving culture of
  past, fast forwarded into modernity, where Pujas, Pandals and Tabernacles are
  as much a part of the landscape of daily life as newbuild factories and
  industry, with all the fall out associated with progress.


  Judah is a Londoner, charged by the architecture of his home turf of more than
  half a century. Driving across London to his studio, he notes the new
  buildings, hoardings, and ongoing demolition making space for the new. Excited
  by the challenges of a continually changing cityscape, it is the geography of
  his environment that informs his work. It is his constant muse.


  His studio in Manor House, North London is a multi-cultural light industrial
  ‘hive’ of studios teaming with creativity. None more so than Judah’s studio.
  Drawings for his forthcoming show are framed and glazed, stacked awaiting
  shipping. The last of his beautiful 3D white paintings are shrouded in plastic
  - quiet epic ghosts against the walls. Structure for ‘The Ark’ a wall mounted
  receptacle for Torahs in polished wood commissioned by his local Synagogue is
  straddled across an expanse of studio floor awaiting construction.


  The early 2000s marked a return for Judah to his prime calling as artist in
  the purist sense. Graduating from Goldsmiths and The Slade in the early 80s,
  he was selected by the Whitechapel for ‘Best of Young Sculptors’. Thereafter
  Production Design proved an exciting outsource for his creativity over two
  decades. Film and theatre were his mainstay working with producers from Ridley
  Scott to Andrei Tartovsky on a myriad of projects such as set design for Tim
  Burton’s **Batman** and **The Festival of Speed** where, for twenty five
  years, Judah has stunned audiences with sculpture podiums towering over
  Goodwood House. These art works have been experiential for the viewer,
  capturing the unspeakable speed and sheer excitement of Formula One.


  Jenny Blyth Fine Art has been working with Judah since 2003 exhibiting his
  work in London (Frontiers at Shoreditch, The Royal Institute of British
  Architects, Louise Blouin Foundation, London Art Fair (Special Projects),
  placing work in international collections (Saatchi Collection, David Roberts
  Collection and more) and securing commissions (Imperial War Museum of the
  North, Wolverhampton Art Gallery…) For exhibition details and images:

  Sculpture commission secured by Jenny Blyth Fine Art.


  THE CRUSADER was created in direct response to global conflict. It reflects on
  modern day wars, whilst recalling the history of world conflict such as the
  faith based Crusades. A powerful and thought-provoking piece, this iconic
  sculpture comprises a 7 metre three-dimensional crucifix covered with a
  lattice of war torn buildings lacquered in snow white redolent of the memorial
  crosses at Flanders Fields. There are a multiplicity of art history references
  recalling to mind early paintings which celebrated the martyrdom of Saint
  Sebastian and the ever present Crown of Thorns, to American minimalist giants
  such as Robert Ryman and Jasper Johns.


  THE CRUSADER is the culmination of five years work in which Gerry Judah
  created a series of three-dimensional paintings of urban decimation focusing
  particularly on the Middle East and Afghanistan, whilst also responding to
  environmental damage resulting from natural disasters such as the Tsunami in
  the Asian Basin, New Orleans in flood ensuing from Hurricane Katrina, and the
  devastation resulting from earthquakes in Haiti and Iceland. Judah’s work
  explores construction and deconstruction, decline and regeneration.


  The setting in Imperial War Museum North’s landmark building - designed by
  internationally celebrated architect Daniel Libeskind to represent a globe
  shattered by conflict - is fitting, given THE CRUSADER’S conceptual references
  and Judah’s exploration of ‘presence of absence’.

  Text by Jenny Blyth © 2013 :


  *The role for contemporary artists is to react and reflect upon life and the
  world around us. They may choose to celebrate form and beauty in figuration or
  abstraction, or perhaps to reflect on the social mores and politics of
  society. They may share with us a visual diary or preoccupation, coloured by
  their personal sensibility, or they may choose to express a sense of
  collective mind. Simultaneously they are creating a distinct artwork that has
  a unique voice and spirit, which will invite us to share their thoughts or
  narrative, whilst also exploring our own.*


  *Gerry Judah’s paintings are a direct response to conflict across the globe,
  and the impact of that violence, whether it is the consequence of war or
  natural disaster. At the same time, he is fascinated by changing urban
  landscape, and his paintings explore the dynamic of construction and
  destruction. It is hard to look at his work without reflecting on conflict in
  the Middle East whether that be Afghanistan, Iraq, or recent months in Gaza.
  There are also echoes of the devastation ensuing from climate change wrought
  by hurricanes, tsunamis, flooding and bushfires that remind us of New Orleans
  underwater, or the aftermath of the Tsunami in the Asian Basin. Although on
  first inspection, Judah’s epic landscapes articulate global concerns for
  peace, he acknowledges the dangers of man’s impact on a finely balanced global
  ecology, and the decimation that unravels as we exploit the planet with an
  ever growing appetite.*


  *Aesthetically, Judah composes a score that is made up of light and shadow.
  The fragility and delicacy of his work is at odds with the force and
  consequence of the concepts that drive him. Despite the darkness of his
  subject matter, he creates an explosion of light permeated with an ethereal
  quality reflecting the cadences and vortices of shattered architecture that we
  witness in daily media reports. His apocalyptic settlements constructed from
  scores of buildings, complete with internal structures, communications and
  water towers are fixed onto canvas, and then systematically destroyed. The
  ensuing rubble and detritus are scattered and fused onto a background of empty
  white canvas with layers of acrylic gesso to create silent ‘white on white’
  abstract paintings.*


  *Transcending issues of politics, race and culture, Judah creates an
  abstracted and disturbing aesthetic that is both mellifluous and pertinent,
  where the ‘presence of absence’ and loss is palpable, and we are confronted
  with the reality and urgency to seek solutions.*
