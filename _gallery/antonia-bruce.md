  **LOVE AND KISSES at Carey Blyth Gallery, Oxford**


  **14 February – 1 March 2020**


  **Antonia Bruce &nbsp; &nbsp;*Milagritos Hearts***


  **Rose Artbuthnott &nbsp; &nbsp;*Portraits***


  *\*Nicholas Arbuthnott &nbsp; &nbsp;*Sculpture\*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; \*\*


  **LOVE & KISSES** an exhibition of work by British artists of drawings,
  paintings, sculpture and photography.


  Antonia Bruce has created cyanotypes of milagritos (small brass folk charms)
  that are purchased in Catholic churches across Mexico in exchange for prayers
  for love, relationships and more… Shaping the milagritos across the page into
  hearts, the offerings are developed onto paper that is brushed with iron
  compound and developed under a Mexican Sun to create the white on blue
  silhouettes of individual prayers.


  **Antonia Bruce** initiated a collaborative exchange between British and
  Mexican artists over five years, responding to the culture of Oaxaca around
  staple foods such as corn, cactus, honey etc… She has also curated a wonderful
  exhibition of ex-votos or devotional paintings that was shown at Wellcome
  Trust in London.&nbsp; Her Milagritos Hearts follow on from the devotional
  theme.&nbsp;


  **Rose Arbuthnott** &nbsp;: \|”*One morning in Mexico, I began the
  inordinately simple task of drawing faces ….”*


  Rose was one of the artists in residency in Part One of the First Foods
  Project.&nbsp; She has created a beautiful body of portraits in charcoal on
  paper and oil on board.&nbsp; Her simple line drawings are powerfully emotive
  catching the pathos in a look, a kiss, a gesture between two lovers.&nbsp;


  Antonia Bruce attended Newcastle Polytechnic and went on to work in Film
  Production.


  **Nicholas Arbuthnott** is showing heads sculpted in stone.&nbsp; His muses
  embrace the classical with lines that recall the elongated melancholy of
  Modigliani and conversely Picasso-esque reference to tribal art and cubism
  expressed in sculpture and paintings such as *Les Demoiselles D’Avignon*.

  Jenny Blyth Fine Art at ART JERICHO


  23 APRIL - 31 MAY 2015


  Surrounding the growing of corn, are the many rituals, offerings, music and
  dance that have evolved since man first cultivated crops. Antonia’s cyanotypes
  capture the corn cobs that tower above the farmers, moving like dancers, in
  the spirit of freedom. Laid against heavy duty watercolour paper which she
  paints with a solution of iron compounds, the silhouettes of her subjects are
  developed in daylight, creating exquisite shadows on blue. This extraordinary
  body of work follows on from Antonia’s previous exhibitions of drawings of
  dancers and pinhole photography. Her chosen medium invariably embraces an
  element of film and movement.


  Corn is the food staff of life, the ‘first food’ for many. The natural
  diversity of maize grown over thousands of years contributes to our treasured
  bio-diversity, and is an essential resource for mankind. Debates over
  genetically modified foods raise issues and concerns for all.


  Antonia Bruce has been working on a cooperative exchange between UK and
  Mexican artists, responding to ‘First Foods’. In Mexico’s *Heartland*,
  ‘everyman’ has a perceived right to his own plot ‘La Milpa’ - to grow his own
  corn, beans and squash. Indeed, the expression Viva La Milpa\! is core to
  Mexican culture.


  Antonia\_: “I worked with plants picked fresh from the field and laid them
  swiftly on prepared paper where they left an imprint of a fleeting moment
  before the sun destroyed them.”\_


  Antonia exhibited Horse Latitudes at Art Jericho in 2010 and Blue Moon in
  2014.

  ### BLUE MOON


  Jenny Blyth Fine Art at ART JERICHO


  17 APRIL - 11 MAY 2014


  Antonia Bruce has created a beautiful portfolio of drawings in Indian ink that
  articulate the language and expression of contemporary dance. Working closely
  with international dancers, she draws from life in the rehearsal studio on
  scrolls of paper. In capturing the myriad forms of movement, she uses a *ph*
  of gestural marks that ranges from broad vigorous brush strokes to delicate
  hair line filaments. At times she adds colour, and perhaps a pure powdered
  cobalt blue for texture.


  Antonia's drawings have a calligraphic quality that reflect the fluidity and
  language of the individual dancers that she works with: Pierrot contemporary
  style sensibility of Marina Collard, classical baroque balletic dance of Susie
  Crow, and a rigour and dynamic that infuses Protein Dance Troupe street
  fights.


  Marina Collard, internationally renowned dancer and choreographer, interleaves
  contemporary dance with bodywork.


  Susie Crow danced for twelve years with the Royal Ballet and Sadlers Wells,
  performing many solo roles, and has a ballet school based in Oxford.


  Luca Silvestrini’s *Protein* is a highly energized, witty and humorous London
  dance troupe that creates vignettes of real life, coloured with theatre and
  drama.


  Marina Collard, Susie Crow and Members of Protein performed at ART JERICHO at
  the Private View of BLUE MOON on Thursday 17 April.


  ## EVENTS :


  May 8 from 6.30-9 pm : Drawing Class with Antonia Bruce and Kassandra
  Isaacson. Rachel Gildea, dancer, to model. &pound;15 - materials supplied.


  May 9 from 7-8.30 pm : Dance Performance from Marina Collard, Susie Crow &

  ### HORSE LATITUDES


  Jenny Blyth Fine Art at ART JERICHO


  7 – 31 OCTOBER 2010


  Jenny Blyth Fine Art and Art Jericho present an exhibition of pin-hole
  photographic images and ink drawings by Antonia Bruce of horses on Port
  Meadow.


  At 30 to 35 Degrees North and South of the Equator, tall ships were often
  becalmed under ridges of high pressure. This was as treacherous to the crew as
  fierce storms on high seas. In this stillness, horses were thrown overboard in
  a bid to conserve food and water. These bands of latitudes became known as The
  Horse Latitudes.


  Antonia Bruce has for some years been engaged by the wild horses on Port
  Meadow – an ancient strip of common land flanking Oxford City and bordered by
  the Thames. In this context, the title draws a parallel to the often ghostly
  sight of the herd on Port Meadow as they stand, quiet, at intervals during the
  day while life goes on around them.


  Intrigued by an encounter with Paul Muldoon’s collection of poems Horse
  Latitudes, and recalling lyrics by The Doors inspired by Horse Latitudes,
  Antonia has transposed her own notion of the ‘horse latitudes’ into pinhole
  compositions.


  Developing her negatives onto paper that she brushes with photographic
  emulsion, Antonia combines photography and painting to create compositions
  that are fragmented and layered, reflective of the interactions of the herd.
  Her photographs are partially abstracted and they pervade an ethereal
  ambivalence.


  Since time immemorial there has existed a primal spirit which has bound man
  and horse. Indeed, in the shaman tradition of Central Asia, the Wind Horse
  represents an allegory for the human soul. Through her use of long exposure,
  Antonia is able to explore the theatre inherent in the daily lives of these
  beautiful and noble creatures. Her compositions are timeless and exquisite,
  and remind the viewer of a shared sensibility.


  Antonia Bruce has explored this concept further with film and a frieze of
  drawings of the horses on Port Meadow characterized by an infinite horizon, in
  brush and ink redolent of calligraphy.


  *Artist Statement:*


  *The title draws a parallel with the often ghostly sight of the herd on Port
  Meadow, an ancient flood plain in Oxford, as they stand, quiet, at intervals
  during the day. Juxtaposed against this huge, flat plain and a constantly
  changing sky the horses can take on a majestic and sometimes melancholy air.*


  *While working with the long exposure which pin hole photography demands, a
  chosen horse would often positively respond to the process standing calmly,
  often for as long as half an hour; the only movement offered being the slight
  shift of its hooves, as it transferred its weight.*


  \_The extended exposure captures the theatre of those moments and many of the
  pictures depict the natural movements of other horses as they wander through
  the frame. Making my own cameras out of wooden boxes gives me the flexibility
  of multiple exposure, some cameras taking as many as six images at one time,
  which gives ʻwalking through frameʼ a completely different meaning as the
  horse effectively walks through six frames. \_


  \_Good days on the Meadow always amounted to incredible silent dialogues with
  the horses, which would often turn into pure theatre and even pantomime. A
  good day in the dark room always came as a huge surprise but could be equally
  sweet. Drawings were all made in situ and offered some respite from the
  technicalities of dark room practice. \_


  *As a result the process becomes integral to the making of the photographs
  which in turn stands for a tiny amount of the many enigmatic experiences that
  I share with everybody who has ever spent time on Port Meadow. The project
  continues to be a simultaneously chaotic and compelling experience. "*&nbsp;
