  PAUL AMEY : 10 July - August 2021&nbsp;


  Carey Blyth Gallery 8 Woodstock Road Oxford OX2 6HT \*\*


  Medium holds no boundaries for Paul AMEY. He is both painter and sculptor of
  forty years. His focus in recent years has been painting, his horizons
  spanning from the beauty and discipline of the Academy, embracing Matisse and
  Bonnard, to the intense Mediterranean palette and contrasting meditative quiet
  of Craigie Aitchison.


  Master painters invariably speak of light and colour, and Amey has mastered
  that: light and colour ignite his paintings. His palette is joyous,
  unexpected, and sculpture, perfected over decades, informs his exploration of
  space. Narrative is very much at the heart of his compositions. His work is
  profoundly competent, deceptively ‘easy on the page’, so that we find
  ourselves transported, chilling at an Ocean Bar, looking out over azure seas
  ….


  Amey’s ***Table Top Series*** invite us to rediscover *still life* where
  commonplace objects are brought to life, whether roses and freesias, or
  discarded shopping bags. They are all divas and he lauds them equally. His
  figures simply complement the main event. As with Bonnard, we come upon them
  as an ‘aside’ - they are quiet, caught in reflection. The detritus of the
  everyday commands centre stage.


  Paul Amey graduated in Fine Art from Hornsey College of Art in 1979. He has
  been painting and sculpting for forty years plus. He set up the Chiltern
  Sculpture Trail in 1990 and taught Fine Art for many years. He exhibited at
  The Museum of Modern Art, Oxford (now Modern Art Oxford) and museums and
  galleries in London and Amsterdam, New York and Los Angeles with sculpture and
  paintings placed in public and private collections.
