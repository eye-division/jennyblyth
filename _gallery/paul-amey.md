  **[…](/)PAUL AMEY**


  Amey is both sculptor and painter. Medium holds no boundaries for him and his
  horizons span from the beauty and discipline of the Academy, embracing Matisse
  and Bonnard, to the delights of Craigie Aitchison and Folk Art.


  Master painters invariably speak of light and colour, and Amey has that. His
  palette is stunning and unexpected whilist sculpture informs his exploration
  of space. &nbsp;Light and colour ignite his paintings whether refracted
  highlights in the ***Swimming Pool Series*** or backlit bars on hot summer
  nights.&nbsp; His ***Table Top Series*** invite us to rediscover *still life*
  where everyday objects become fascinating to us, whether the delicate lacework
  of freesias or discarded shopping bags – each are equally playful.


  Paul Amey graduated in Fine Art from Hornsey College of Art in 1979.&nbsp; He
  has been painting and sculpting for thirty years plus.&nbsp; He set up the
  Chiltern Sculpture Trail in 1990 and taught Fine Art for many years.&nbsp; He
  has exhibited at Modern Art, Oxford and museums and galleries in London and
  Amsterdam, New York and Los Angeles with sculpture and paintings placed in
  public and private collections.
