  **PAUL AMEY**


  **Currently showing at CAREY BLYTH 8 Woodstock Road OX2 6HT**


  Paul Amey is both sculptor and painter. Medium holds no boundaries for him and
  his horizons span from the beauty and discipline of the Academy, embracing
  Matisse and Bonnard, to the delights of Craigie Aitchison and Folk Art.


  Master painters invariably speak of light and colour, and Amey has that. His
  palette is stunning and unexpected whilst sculpture informs his exploration of
  space. &nbsp;Light and colour ignite his paintings whether refracted
  highlights in the ***Swimming Pool Series*** or backlit bars on hot summer
  nights.&nbsp; His ***Table Top Series*** invite us to rediscover *still life*
  where everyday objects become fascinating to us and whether flowers or
  discarded shopping bags – he is equally playful with each subject.


  Paul Amey graduated in Fine Art from Hornsey College of Art in 1979.&nbsp; He
  has been painting and sculpting for thirty five years plus.&nbsp; He set up
  the Chiltern Sculpture Trail in 1990 and taught fine art for many years.&nbsp;
  He has exhibited at Modern Art, Oxford and museums and galleries in London and
  Amsterdam, New York and Los Angeles with sculpture and paintings placed in
  public and private collections.
