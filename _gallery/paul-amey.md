  **PAUL AMEY : From 10 July - August 2021&nbsp;**


  **at Carey Blyth Gallery**


  **8 Woodstock Road Oxford OX2 6HT&nbsp;**


  Medium holds no boundaries for Paul AMEY.&nbsp; He is both painter and
  sculptor of forty years. His focus in recent years has been painting, his
  horizons spanning from the beauty and discipline of the Academy, embracing
  Matisse and Bonnard, to the intense Mediterranean palette and contrasting
  meditative quiet of Craigie Aitchison.


  Master painters invariably speak of light and colour, and Amey has mastered
  that: light and colour ignite his paintings. &nbsp;His palette is joyous,
  unexpected, and sculpture, perfected over decades, informs his exploration of
  space.&nbsp; Narrative is very much at the heart of his compositions.&nbsp;
  His work is profoundly competent, deceptively ‘easy on the page’, so that we
  find ourselves transported, chilling at an Ocean Bar, looking out over azure
  seas ….


  Amey’s ***Table Top Series*** invite us to rediscover *still life* where
  commonplace objects are brought to life, whether roses and freesias, or
  discarded shopping bags. They are all divas and he lauds them equally. His
  figures simply complement the main event.&nbsp; As with Bonnard, we come upon
  them as an ‘aside’ - they are quiet, caught in reflection. The detritus of the
  everyday commands centre stage.&nbsp;


  Paul Amey graduated in Fine Art from Hornsey College of Art in 1979.&nbsp; He
  has been painting and sculpting for forty years plus.&nbsp; He set up the
  Chiltern Sculpture Trail in 1990 and taught Fine Art for many years.&nbsp; He
  exhibited at The Museum of Modern Art, Oxford (now Modern Art Oxford) and
  museums and galleries in London and Amsterdam, New York and Los Angeles with
  sculpture and paintings placed in public and private collections.
