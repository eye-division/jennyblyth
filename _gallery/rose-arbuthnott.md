  **Rose Arbuthnott** &nbsp;:&nbsp; &nbsp; ”***One morning in Mexico, I began
  the inordinately simple task of drawing faces …**.”*


  Rose was one of the artists in residency in Part One of the First Foods
  Project.&nbsp; She has created a beautiful body of portraits in charcoal on
  paper and oil on board.&nbsp; Her simple line drawings are powerfully emotive
  catching the pathos in a look, a kiss, a gesture between two lovers.&nbsp;


  The artists invites us to share her insights whilst exploring our own.&nbsp;
  Arbuthnott's drawings convey a kaleidescope of emotion from curiosity -
  hesitant at times wistful, intimate - sometimes guarded, the joy and the angst
  of the heart and the passion - achieved in simple lines in charcoal on
  paper.&nbsp; The subjects for her oils on board, like her drawings are young,
  direct, strong, each one distinct from another.


  &nbsp;Rose studied Fine Art and History of Art at Edinburgh University, set up
  the Owl Barn artist residency in Gloucestershire and was artist in residence
  as part of the first foods project in Mexico 2014.


  ***Rose Arbuthnott : "What I really want to talk about is the difficulty of
  making art in the ominous current situation of global climate change, and the
  consumer culture and capitalism that seems to be driving it. In this context I
  am making art to support my living. Almost all of us are doing something like
  this – consuming the world’s resources to keep our puny lives afloat, even if
  for me this is only wood and oil paint (I am anti-plastics and don’t use
  acrylic; although we need all the trees we can keep deeply anchored in the
  ground just where they are, wood is at least a renewable resource). And at
  least paintings are for life and not discardable objects. But aren’t I just
  fuelling the same system that sort of works for humans but doesn’t work for
  the planet? Since we live here and can only live here we need an alternative
  pronto. So what I am suggesting is that the money that I receive from the
  selling of my pictures will be used to support my research and activism,
  possible because as a painter I have the privilege of time...."***
