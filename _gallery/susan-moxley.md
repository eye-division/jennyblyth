  *Growing up in South Africa, Susan Moxley achieved the highest results in the
  country for a Degree in Fine Art from Natal College of Art. She travelled to
  London for a Post Grad in Printmaking and Illustration graduating with
  Distinction before returning to South Africa for twelve months where she
  joined a political group, was blacklisted, and determined to make a life as an
  artist in Europe.*


  Working with mixed media, SM is a printmaker supreme, creating exquisite
  prints, collages, sculpture and jewellery. Although her work is based in
  figuration, it is largely abstracted. Concepts and politics remain important
  to her. Her new body of work focuses particularly on ‘textile paintings’ with
  sculpture that celebrates music and the beauty of the female form.


  Splitting their time between UK and Greece, SM and her husband Korky Paul,
  have maintained a home together as artists on Kythera, home to Aphrodite - one
  of seven Ionian islands, for more than 40 years. On the outskirts of the
  village where they live, is a municipal dump picked over by cats where SM has
  sourced discarded homemade cloth and blankets. Goats’ hair and flax was spun
  into coarse wool that was traditionally woven on home looms into hardwearing
  blankets. Laid out beneath the olive trees, they were used to collect the
  olives harvested from the branches overhead. Felt for blankets and clothing
  was made from sheep’s wool by rubbing the wool with salt water at the sea’s
  edge to create a thick matted material. Traditional methods have long since
  been lost. Islanders often winter in Athens. The women no longer sit out
  beneath the trees talking and stitching. They no longer weave, and the skills
  are not passed down to younger women. Hand-woven blankets handed down over
  generations as family heirlooms have been thrown out. For artists, what we
  discard often affords a treasure trove, and for SM the cloth remnants that she
  finds amongst the rubbish are indeed treasure, infused with the essence of the
  islanders and their land.


  The felted wools and woven fabrics were coloured with natural pigments and
  minerals from earth and rock, plants and animals, infused with the family song
  of hard manual work and thrift that underpinned traditional life on the
  island. SM’s *mement**i*** represent the women, working a fine balance of
  austerity and creativity - an apron marked with cooking oil, a fragment of
  blanket darned, and over-darned… Some of the fabrics, heavy with flax like
  fine chainmail, are over 100 years old. As Sufi food is made with love, so too
  were the handmade fabrics that brought warmth and joy beyond the practical, a
  binding together of generations and community.


  From her carefully selected remnants*,* SM creates abstracted landscapes,
  vignettes of a beloved Greek Isle, that despite modernity in a fast-changing
  world remains beautiful, captivating and the source of her inspiration. Living
  six months a year for more than four decades on Kythera, she has observed
  first-hand how traditions have been displaced by modernity as we know it
  today, albeit slower in the relative quiet of the islands. She has raised her
  children, as neighbour and friend to the grandmothers of today and yesteryear
  who were at the heart of the culture that colours her compositions. Figures
  depicted in her sculpture series are inspired by the women that she has
  observed over decades whether collecting and carrying wood, felting, sewing –
  a harsh life but in harmony with land, creating that family song and pride in
  the community.


  Although she acknowledges Greece to be a matriarchal society at heart, she
  describes the women as ‘vessels’ whilst simultaneously ‘contained’ within
  their homes, as much by tradition as by the physicality of the tasks that that
  coloured their lives. Contemporary life has liberated the younger generation,
  yet with that freedom so much that has characterized the island and their
  lives has been lost, and SM sees the narrative unfolding in Kythera as a
  microcosm of what is happening globally as we advance technologically marching
  ever faster towards an AI world.


  ***Long Storm*** is a four metre landscape that follows the gathering storm.
  SM’s stitching captures the movement of the wind increasing in intensity as it
  spins and dances a path between the houses, across the sky. The geometry of
  her chosen fabrics speaks of the distinctive architecture of houses that we
  see in her paintings, coloured by minerals and plants indigenous to the
  island. The tones echo the sun-bleached whites of the buildings, rust-red
  earth, and the azure blue of sea and sky. Storms are an increasing phenomenon
  on Kythera where despite being surrounded by sea, they are short of water.


  Tripping over a violin case on the street close to home in Oxford, a quiet
  mecca for world class music, triggered a series of beautiful sculptures that
  follow on from earlier paintings of the female form. Opening out the case, SM
  has lined the inside with remnants of handwoven blankets overlaid with
  hand-stitched wool that delineate the female body - a mellifluous mix of music
  and form. They are playful, with a distinctly auditory sensibility. Excited by
  her find, she sourced further casings online.


  Long has the hour-glass shape of the violin been associated with the female
  form, as celebrated by Man Ray’s iconic photograph of the naked woman from
  behind in ***Violin d’Ingres***. The very naming of parts of the instrument
  echo female body parts – the cinch of the waist, the neck, rib and belly…
  Whereas today women and men violinists are celebrated side by side, the
  playing of the violin has in the past often been considered the domain of men.
  Although Mozart, celebrated Regina Sacchi commending her highly for her
  virtuosity, Yehudi Menuhin said that*…* “*The handling and playing of the
  violin is a process of caress and evocation, of drawing out a sound that
  awaits the hands of a master”.* Women, particularly in Victorian times, were
  vilified for playing an instrument that ‘polite society’ thought should be
  ‘caressed’ by male violinists. (***Note: 1)***


  Doubly enchanting then to see SM’s ceramic nude with notes of Cycladic
  figurines, in 3D white slab with edges pinched, bisque fired, the
  ivory-coloured horse hair of the bow running from clavicle to pubic bone.
  Matisse-like in their simplicity, her sculptures convey the aesthetics of
  music and beauty, whilst giving voice also to elements of the animal spirits
  infused into the making of the instruments – cat and sheep gut, horse hair and
  elephant tusk for the box, the bow strings, and ivory decoration. With goods
  bound and balanced above, Susan reminds us of the working lives of women of
  Africa, land of her birth, that celebrate culture whilst reminding us of the
  basics of subsistence farming and life where the duress of gathering wood and
  water daily is a reality.
