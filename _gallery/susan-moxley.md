  **Susan MOXLEY**


  ***Text by Jenny Blyth***


  *Enquiries : jennyblythart@gmail.com*


  Susan Moxley grew up in South Africa where she graduated with distinction from
  Durban School of Art travelling to London for a Post Graduate Degree in
  Printmaking. On her return to South Africa she worked for an NGO, but soon
  returned again, determined to make a life as an artist in Europe.


  Working in a variety of media, Susan creates exquisite collaged textiles,
  ceramic sculpture and monographs, hand coloured and collaged with chine
  colle.  Although her work is based in ﬁguration, it is largely abstracted.
  Social politics and narratives remain important to her.


  FRESH ART FAIR Cheltenham 2025 showcases her new work - textiles, ceramics and
  monographs (hand coloured, collaged with chine colle) - reﬂecting the changing
  traditions of community on an island in Greece that remains beautiful and
  captivating in a fast-changing world.


  Textiles


  **‘*****My stitched paintings have a fragility. I use the same methods of
  stitch and repair that I ﬁnd on the cloth, with all the faults and
  imperfections that contribute to the island’s stories, inspiring me to draw
  their narratives into the present. I impose my own stories whilst always being
  aware and respectful of the island women who made them. Each piece is a
  palimpsest - altered, superimposed, re-contextualised while still bearing
  traces of its former use’*****.**


  Susan Moxley 2025


  Splitting their time between UK and Greece, Susan and husband Korky Paul, have
  maintained a home as artists on an Ionian island for more than four decades.
  Over the years, she has collected old, hand spun yarns and handwoven
  functional fabrics. Their patinas, stains and darned patches speak of the
  island’s past austerity when resources were precious and everything was reused
  and recycled. Traditional weaving methods have long been lost with the
  post-war migration, commercial development and availability of modern
  industrially-made textiles. The discarded fabrics that she selects for her
  ‘textile paintings’ were woven by women on heavy wooden looms from goat and
  sheep’s wool, ﬂax, cotton and linen that were grown, spun on the island and
  dyed with natural pigments.


  While raising her children Susan spent many evenings with older women,
  learning their crafts and listening to their stories of village life,
  hardships, song and myth. She stitched these stories into the found fabrics
  while superimposing her own observations, feelings and artistic experiences,
  using the found fabrics as her canvas and palate, their repairs, tares and
  textures as inspiration and her stitched thread as the drawn line.


  First Storm is a 2m collaged landscape that follows a gathering storm. The
  work acknowledges the impact of climate change on the island where water is
  scarce. Susan’s stitching captures the movement of the wind increasing in
  intensity as it spins and dances a path between the houses, across the sky.
  The geometry that she creates in her kaleidoscope of chosen fabrics speaks of
  the distinctive architecture, coloured by the earth’s pigments and ﬂora. The
  tones echo the sun-bleached whites of the buildings, rust-red earth, and the
  azure blue of sea and sky.


  During her search for hand woven fabrics, Susan found a discarded violin case.
  She has lined the case in woollen fabric, the female form, stitched in red
  thread creates a playful fusion of music and beauty. Her Violin Women are a
  conduit between the textiles and the ceramics.


  The connection between Woman and Pithari (vessel) is a recurring theme across
  Susan’s artistic practice - woman as container, container as woman.


  Susan’s Pitharia in stoneware and terracotta celebrate the simplicity and
  aesthetic of the ancient Cycladic female forms with their ﬂat planes and
  geometric shapes that so inspired Picasso. There is an honesty and poise to
  Susan’s ceramic slab -built, bisque fired and waxed nudes, pared back to the
  abstract. The beautiful ***Pithari with Minoan Bird*** above, strung with
  ivory-coloured horse hair of the violin bow from clavicle to pubic bone, is
  one in a series of Woman as Vessel, while others hint at the weight of women’s
  daily labours - balancing firewood, bowls, spindles, loom weights, bolts of
  fabric , and birds.
