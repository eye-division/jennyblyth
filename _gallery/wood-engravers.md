  ### SOCIETY OF WOOD ENGRAVERS

  **ART JERICHO**

  **20 November - 28 December 2014**

  (Note: Art Jericho, 6 King Street, Oxford OX2 6DF. Opening Hours: Wed-Sun 12-6 pm. Closed for Christmas 25, 26, 27 December).

  The Society of Wood Engravers was founded back in 1920\. Past annual exhibitions include the work of artists such as Paul Nash, Paul Gauguin and Clare Leighton. When the Second World War broke out, the Wood Engravers in the society suffered, as the demand for their work was interrupted and access to materials was made near impossible. The Society was revived in the 1980's, and is now made up of over 70 practicing artists as members, and has built up a national reputation for excellence. They are the only organisation currently that are linking together both Wood Engravers and those who are interested in the medium, throughout Britain and all over the world.

  Art Jericho have hosted the Society of Wood Engravers every year for the past 5 years, and it has always been an extremely popular show with visitors travelling from far afield to see the work on exhibition. One of the reasons that this show has been so popular is the level of skill and artisanship that is core to the work. These incredibly intricate images are carved into wood from which the engravings are then printed. The subject matter is very varied from rural and city landscapes to still lives and nature. This is the first year that Jenny Blyth Fine Art has hosted The Society of Wood Engravers at Art Jericho.
