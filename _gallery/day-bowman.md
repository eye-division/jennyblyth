  **Day BOWMAN** currently showing new work in **Earth & Angels** at the
  Brookfield space at 30 Fenchurch Street, Bishopsgate, City of London **until
  14 February 2025**.  Two man show with Gerry JUDAH.


  Fresh from the studio, **Marking the Boundaries** refers to the controlled
  burning of moorland to inhibit wildfires that dazzled Day as a child. This
  series of paintings captures the texture and colours of the moors with strong
  lines demarcating zones to be burnt where rust-coloured earth, hot flames and
  the black of charred stubble are set against sky blues.


  DB’s new series 2024 explores the land in *Marking the Boundaries.* ***Swaling
  1*** (above) placed in beautiful collection in Crete.  Despite the setting
  surrounded by azure seas, water is an issue for the islands as summer
  temperatures soar.  As a child, Day observed the ‘marking off’ of the land for
  controlled moor fires. She continues to engage with global concerns from
  climate change to migration.  As ever Day brings energy and passion to the
  canvas finding the poetry within however tough the subject. **<br><br>Day

  **Day Bowman : Seaside Citadels : June 2021**                             
  Bermondsey Project Space London, curated by Jenny Blyth.


  Our coastal boundaries appointed with castles and fortresses of old, protected
  us for hundreds of years against invaders from foreign lands. The geography of
  an island nation worked in our favour. Those citadels of stone that spangled
  cliff tops looking out across the seas, were long ago abandoned, but their
  ruins remain as reminders to us of past invaders and would-be victors. That
  sense of vulnerability has not been dispelled. Our borders are now politically
  fortified in a bid to control the complexities of global migration. The
  layering of history and politics, like the littoral shoreline of sand, sea and
  sky is constantly in flux.


  Reflecting upon her personal life journey through a poetic response to the
  beauty of nature, Bowman captures the play of light on wet sands, but does not
  shy away from the contentious issues of global politics that underpin and
  impact our transient lives. All is captured in her beautiful paintings of
  *Fortresses* and *Seaside Citadels*.


  Combining the fine art of drawing with that of painting comes naturally to
  her. Bowman’s abstract expressionist paintings, in charcoal and conte over oil
  on canvas, are mille feuille - complex yet fluent, strident and charged, they
  intuitively balance the brittle notes of humanity against the fragility of
  endeavour.


  For all of us together on this earth, the catharsis of walking barefoot along
  the shoreline, is primal - the criss-cross of shallow incoming tides erasing
  our sadnesses like footprints from *Plashy Places.* For Day Bowman, returning
  to the coastal landscape of her childhood, it is manna for the soul. As we
  release ourselves to the elements, we find a path to peace and healing.

  **DAY BOWMAN :  Plashy
  Places**

  How deeply are etched within us our childhood memories - where time stood
  still, the days unending, where our sources of delight and adventure were
  imbued with a sense of wonder, where everything felt yet to be discovered.


  Day Bowman’s childhood days were spent in the Somerset town of Minehead, and
  it is the landscape of that unassuming post-industrial beach town that forms
  the bedrock for her painting. Her hometown was recorded in the Domesday Book
  but dates back to the Bronze Age. Strategically located on the coast, it grew
  from busy trading post in the 1500s to industrial town of the 1800s shipping
  herring, wool, cattle and coal to Bristol, Wales and Ireland. Industry fell
  away to larger ports, leaving a detritus of abandoned mining and industrial
  ‘architecture’. With a new railway line and a pier, Minehead re-emerged as a
  fashionable Edwardian seaside resort, and remains today a bucket-and-spade
  summer holiday destination.


  There is an echo to the ’layering’ in this coastal town that we see in
  Bowman’s work. Her paintings are complex. Her skill is the alchemy of
  juxtaposing the different elements that command her attention, composing
  abstract paintings that are balanced and fluid. There is terrific strength and
  confidence in her work. Movement abounds. She balances blocks of black with
  trapeziums of rust, where ribbons of colour and charcoal encircle pools of
  light, and scribbled hearts and footprints belie the depth of darker planes
  and corners.


  It is the behind-the-scenes landscape of a ghosted industry and deserted
  winter beaches that fire her imagination. Bowman’s paintings are experiential
  - ***Urban Wastelands*** resonate with the echo of footsteps - running ‘tag’
  through giant concrete tunnels, the plink of metal on metal, the dynamic and
  drama of a wasteland tableaux that characterized ‘playgrounds’ for children of
  the sixties.


  Bowman returns to the beaches of childhood in her recent paintings of *Plashy
  Places.* Wet sand glistens as the incoming and receding tides of ‘*Flood and
  Ebb’* erase calligraphic marks etched momentarily into surface, where the
  pooling of seawater and reflections play out in oil on canvas. Capturing the
  abandon of play, Bowman recalls W B Yeats’ *Man From Faeryland,* who, careworn
  with the fears and concerns of adulthood, observes the humble lugworm rising
  to the surface, singing of higher places and golden skies …


  Bowman’s new and larger paintings of *Holiday Destinations I, II & III*
  combine elements of both beach and wasteland. A ribbon of sky blue colours up
  against rust and golden ochres, where spectrums of ghost whites and greys
  ignite against the drama of a black backdrop.


  While her post-industrial abstractions resonate with rigour and dynamic,
  sculpting shape and movement across the canvas, so Day Bowman’s beach
  paintings of ***Plashy Places*** capture the magic and beauty of the littoral
  shoreline, a perpetual dance between sea and land - that tangential, kinetic
  point at which figuration and abstraction play out.  *Text by Jenny

  ***DB “**There is a kind of cruel beauty in the destruction we create - for
  me, the oil depot, stacked piping and overhead cables have superseded the
  rivers and hills of the traditional picturesque.”*


  *Painting is central to my practice as an artist. By this, I do not mean that
  it is to the exclusion of all other activities such as drawing, collage and
  printmaking that are integral to the work that I produce on canvas. As a
  painter, I work in series which allows me to focus and explore the subject in
  depth.”*


  Day Bowman is emerging as one of the UK’s most exciting contemporary painters.
  Drawing inspiration from post industrial landscape, Day has written her own
  alphabet and language of painting. You can clearly distinguish the origins for
  her gestural marks that refer back to a childhood spent exploring urban
  wastelands, a landscape that continues to excite and inspire her. Flat colour
  planes, ink spills and ribbons of colour interleave symbols that once were
  gasometers, containers and huge concrete piping. Perfected over years, Day
  creates abstract expressionist paintings that are charged and fluid - dynamic
  in form and joyous in palette.
