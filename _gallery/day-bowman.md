  **Foreword by Jenny Blyth.&nbsp;** (Catalogue available upon request)


  Our coastal boundaries appointed with castles and fortresses of old, protected
  us for hundreds of years against invaders from foreign lands.&nbsp; The
  geography of an island nation worked in our favour.&nbsp; Those citadels of
  stone that spangled cliff tops looking out across the seas, were long ago
  abandoned, but their ruins remain as reminders to us of past invaders and
  would-be victors. That sense of vulnerability has not been dispelled.&nbsp;
  Our borders are now politically fortified in a bid to control the complexities
  of global migration.&nbsp; The layering of history and politics, like the
  littoral shoreline of sand, sea and sky is constantly in flux.


  Reflecting upon her personal life journey through a poetic response to the
  beauty of nature, Bowman captures the play of light on wet sands, but does not
  shy away from the contentious issues of global politics that underpin and
  impact our transient lives.&nbsp; All is captured in her beautiful paintings
  of *Fortresses* and *Seaside Citadels*.&nbsp;&nbsp;


  Combining the fine art of drawing with that of painting comes naturally to
  her. &nbsp;Bowman’s abstract expressionist paintings, in charcoal and conte
  over oil on canvas, are mille feuille - complex yet fluent, strident and
  charged, they intuitively balance the brittle notes of humanity against the
  fragility of endeavor.&nbsp;


  For all of us together on this earth, the catharsis of walking barefoot along
  the shoreline, is primal - the criss-cross of shallow incoming tides erasing
  our sadnesses like footprints from *Plashy Places.*&nbsp; For Day Bowman,
  returning to the coastal landscape of her childhood, it is manna for the soul.
  &nbsp;As we release ourselves to the elements, we find a path to peace and
  healing.


  ### *DAY BOWMAN&nbsp; 'Plashy Places'*


  #### Carey Blyth Gallery , Oxford


  #### **6 March - 5 April 2020**


  **Text by Jenny Blyth**


  How deeply are etched within us our childhood memories - where time stood
  still, the days unending, where our sources of delight and adventure were
  imbued with a sense of wonder, where everything felt yet to be discovered.


  Day Bowman’s childhood days were spent in the Somerset town of Minehead, and
  it is the landscape of that unassuming post-industrial beach town that forms
  the bedrock for her painting. &nbsp;Her hometown was recorded in the Domesday
  Book but dates back to the Bronze Age. Strategically located on the coast, it
  grew from busy trading post in the 1500s to industrial town of the 1800s
  shipping herring, wool, cattle and coal to Bristol, Wales and Ireland.
  Industry fell away to larger ports, leaving a detritus of abandoned mining and
  industrial ‘architecture’.&nbsp; With a new railway line and a pier, Minehead
  re-emerged as a fashionable Edwardian seaside resort, and remains today a
  bucket-and-spade summer holiday destination.


  There is an echo to the ’layering’ in this coastal town that we see in
  Bowman’s work.&nbsp; Her paintings are complex.&nbsp; Her skill is the alchemy
  of juxtaposing the different elements that command her attention, composing
  abstract paintings that are balanced and fluid.&nbsp; There is terrific
  strength and confidence in her work. Movement abounds.&nbsp; She balances
  blocks of black with trapeziums of rust, where ribbons of colour and charcoal
  encircle pools of light, and scribbled hearts and footprints belie the depth
  of darker planes and corners.


  It is the ‘*behind the scenes’* landscape of a ghosted industry and deserted
  winter beaches that fire her imagination. Bowman’s paintings are experiential
  - ***Urban Wastelands*** &nbsp;resonate with the echo of footsteps - running
  ‘tag’ through giant concrete tunnels, the plink of metal on metal, the dynamic
  and drama of a wasteland tableaux that characterized ‘playgrounds’ for
  children of the sixties.


  Bowman returns to the beaches of childhood in her recent paintings of
  *\*\*Plashy Places. \*\**Wet sand glistens as the incoming and receding tides
  of '*Flood and Ebb'* &nbsp;erase calligraphic marks etched momentarily into
  surface, where the pooling of seawater and reflections play out in oil on
  canvas. Capturing the abandon of play, Bowman recalls W B Yeats’ *Man From
  Faeryland,* who, careworn with the fears and concerns of adulthood, observes
  the humble lugworm rising to the surface, singing of higher places and golden
  skies …


  Bowman’s new and larger paintings of *\*\*Holiday Destinations I, II & III
  \*\**combine elements of both beach and wasteland. A ribbon of sky blue
  colours up against rust and golden ochres, where spectrums of ghost whites and
  greys ignite against the drama of a black backdrop.


  While her post-industrial abstractions resonate with rigour and dynamic,
  sculpting shape and movement across the canvas, so Day Bowman’s beach
  paintings of ***Plashy Places*** &nbsp;capture the magic and beauty of the
  littoral shoreline, a perpetual dance between sea and land - that tangential,
  kinetic point at which figuration and abstraction play out.&nbsp;


  *2019 has been a big year for Day Bowman. She was the Winner of the **Anima
  Mundi International Painting 2019** at **Venice Biennale 2019**; awarded First
  Prize for Painting in **Bath Arts Open 2019**; and won First Prize in the
  **Wales Contemporary 2019**. A graduate of Chelsea School of Art and London
  University, she has exhibited widely with solo exhibitions over 15 years
  touring in Museums across UK, Germany and China where in 2017 she showed with
  Contemporary Masters from Britain. In 2012 she was commissioned to create
  giant hoardings across Weymouth to mark the Olympic Sailing.&nbsp; She has
  paintings in international collections, and works from her studios in London
  and Dorset.*


  ### DAY BOWMAN &nbsp; *'ALCHEMY'*&nbsp;


  #### 4 January - 8 February 2015


  #### Art Jericho 6 King Street Oxford


  Day Bowman is emerging as one of the UK's most exciting contemporary painters.
  Drawing inspiration from post industrial landscape, Day has written her own
  alphabet and language of painting. You can clearly distinguish the origins for
  her gestural marks that refer back to a childhood spent exploring urban
  wastelands, a landscape that continues to excite and inspire her. Flat colour
  planes, ink spills and ribbons of colour interleave symbols that once were
  gasometers, containers and huge concrete piping. Perfected over years, Day
  creates abstract expressionist paintings that feel like jazz fusion. Her
  paintings are charged and fluid - dynamic in form and joyous in palette.


  ***Day Bowman: &nbsp; \*\***There is a kind of cruel beauty in the destruction
  we create - for me, the oil depot, stacked piping and overhead cables have
  superseded the rivers and hills of the traditional picturesque.*


  *Painting is central to my practice as an artist. By this, I do not mean that
  it is to the exclusion of all other activities such as drawing, collage and
  printmaking that are integral to the work that I produce on canvas. As a
  painter, I work in series which allows me to focus and explore the subject in
  depth.*

  Blyth :


  When we cast our mind to the British coastline, we may recall blustery winds
  on high cliff tops and beautiful beaches, or by contrast that singularly
  British phenomenon of piers and fun fairs. Day Bowman’s view of the British
  coastline is another vision entirely. For her it is the last frontier of
  wilderness. Growing up in Minehead in the fifties, she far preferred the beach
  out of season, and the long stretches of empty sands. “I like that out of
  season emptiness, the windswept promenade, ripped hoardings, and closed-up
  shops and stalls.” There is evidence of settlements around Minehead that go
  back to the Bronze Age, but the port at Minehead was established in the late
  1300’s and over five centuries grew to a thriving port, trading not only with
  Ireland and Wales for livestock, wool and coal, but sending ships as far a
  field as the West Indies and Virginia. As the ‘glory days’ of the Industrial
  Age declined, Minehead was developed by the Edwardians into a residential
  seaside town, popular for holidays and retirement. The architecture of
  discarded industry is however still evident in the landscape, and it is this
  industrial wasteland that fires Day Bowman’s new paintings. When pressed for
  the source of fascination for a landscape that is on the surface bleak, Bowman
  speaks in part of memory and loss. The childhood years that she spent
  exploring those wastelands had made a profound impression on her, but it was
  the departure from Minehead in primary years, a consequence of her parents
  separation, that triggered a longing and wistfulness for a landscape that to
  her remains exciting and dynamic - pyramids of coal too high to scramble over,
  reels of barbed wire, and hollow pipes large enough to walk through. But
  Bowman’s journey of discovery through painting goes far beyond the personal,
  and it is exciting to see how her narrative unravels. “When we think of the
  seaside we think of beautiful beaches, but much of our coastline is not like
  that. It is often a strange and unfamiliar wilderness. I find that the
  overlooked corners of our island offer an alternative view of architecture and
  how it has shaped the landscape”. “Water Zones” and “Urban Wastelands” evolved
  out of earlier more personal projects such as “The Compass” and “Sandmarking
  Series”, her focus shifting from seaside resorts and beaches to the
  ‘edgelands’ of a post-industrial era that border much of our coastline. Bowman
  has broadened her narrative to embrace not only personal but also collective
  memories associated with transmigration. Introducing a sense of movement and
  journeying into the fabric of her work, Bowman reflects on the architecture of
  industrial wasteland created from disused quays, rusting hulks and oil drums
  that mark the point of departure and arrival for an ongoing exchange of
  stowaways, sailors and immigrants across the ages. Presented in association
  with “Jonah and The Whale,”a short film beautifully composed by award-winning
  film maker Ian Knox, and music by Steve Harris, “Water Zones” marked a turning
  point for Bowman, in which she identified and developed an alphabet of
  language with which to paint. Her alphabet consists of the disused gasometers,
  discarded containers, the rusting detritus of metal from objects no longer
  relevant or useful. The language that she has created celebrated the
  physicality and form of those objects, a literally hard edged and flinty
  figuration where those objects became paramount. You can see clearly looking
  at her composition in Water Zones and Urban Wastelands that Bowman’s painting
  has grown out of collage, and indeed she remains faithful to that medium in
  smaller works. Having mastered the alphabet of the objects that informed Water
  Zones, she created Urban Wastelands using a language in which she has become
  fluent, and by freeing up her composition, she is able to create large
  beautiful contemporary paintings that fly. She describes the process as having
  “to forget what you have learned, to loosen up and to simply make these marks
  which have now become a part of me”. Her new body of abstracted paintings have
  therefore grown out of figuration, and are most successful on that hairline
  where figuration meets abstraction. Bowman retains her edge, but flat colour
  planes, ink spills and ribbons of colour interleave the shapes that reference
  symbols and marks which once were gasometers, containers and hollow piping.
  Through abstraction, and in spite of the gravitas of the narrative, there is a
  sense of delight in her gestural marking whereby the compositions become more
  about space, form, light and texture and the sheer enjoyment of painting. You
  can clearly perceive her influences and favoured masters, the colour and space
  of Irwin and De Kooning, the movement and dynamic of Bacon. Her palette is
  unfettered by the base subject matter where peach pinks and oranges sit
  unashamedly alongside gun metal grey. The Urban Wastelands Project presents
  paintings by Day Bowman in association with a remake of Ian Knox’s “Jonah and
  The Whale”, and music from Trans Global Underground “Unite – A gathering of
  Strangers”. The music of Trans Global Underground is a haunting fusion of
  cultural influences from Arabic “Call to Prayer” to Celtic Folk. Infused with
  sadness and the longing for homes left far behind, the songs are set to the
  rhythmic beating of electronic instruments which echo the imagery of Knox’s
  film and the texture and surface of concrete and metal inherent in Bowman’s
  paintings. Embracing geopolitical issues of mass transmigration, The Urban
  Wastelands Project is a compelling journey through the tough forgotten corners
  of our marine wastelands that is both brittle and beautiful.


  ### BELIEF & BEYOND


  **Paintings by DAY BOWMAN and MICH&Egrave;LE JAFF&Eacute; PEARCE**


  **5 March - 12 May 2012**


  **BELIEF & BEYOND** is an exhibition of new paintings by two contemporary
  London artists which will be held in the first floor exhibition space of
  Barclays flagship Piccadilly Branch in the heart of London’s West End. The
  exhibition curated by Jenny Blyth has been arranged with the support of
  Barclays Premier Banking.


  Day Bowman’s exhibition The Urban Wastelands Project has been touring the
  South West of UK since July 2011. Mich&egrave;le Jaffé Pearce is involved with
  The Three Faiths Forum and exhibited at the Interfaith Arts Festival organised
  by TFF at the Candid Arts Trust, Islington in January 2010. Jenny Blyth,
  curator and fine art consultant, is based in Oxford.


  Mich&egrave;le Jaffé-Pearce trained in Fine Art at Sir John Cass and
  thereafter studied sculpture at Chelsea School of Art. Her painting is founded
  in a contemporary expression of faith through an exploration of Jewish
  mysticism, Chassidic stories, biblical poetry and the Hebrew alphabet.
  Mich&egrave;le uses symbolism and abstraction to create spiritual pathways on
  a journey of belief. Strong colour and form asserts a vibrant sense of
  optimism and a spirit of renewal.


  Day Bowman’s painting takes us on a compelling journey beyond our habitual
  comfort zones to the wild and deserted industrial wastelands that fringe our
  urban abode and infrastructure and our designated coastal countryside. Her
  paintings, which are both brittle and beautiful, celebrate these tough and
  forgotten ‘Edgelands’, exploring the twilight zone between figuration and
  abstraction. Day Bowman studied painting at Chelsea School of Art and London
  University.
