  ### BUTTERMILK

  ### PHOTOGRAPHY THROUGH THE EYE OF A PAINTER

  **8 - 15 NOVEMBER 2009**

  Jenny Blyth Fine Art in association with Art Jericho presents a new exhibition of photography by GEORGE IRVINE.

  Irvine is both painter and photographer, and in this collection of photographs, selected from over 25,000 amassed over a period of five years, he invites us to explore through the eye of a Painter. BUTTERMILK springs from the rural beauty that surrounds Irvine in idyllic English countryside. Focusing on the trappings and fixtures of a working farm that catch his eye, Irvine transforms found objects to infer landscape which he brings to life through composition, light and colour. Thus, an iced trough turned upside down creates a waterfall with swirling pool, and the underside of a fibreglass boat morphs to cliffs and high skies.

  Calling to mind Turner and Rothko, Irvineâ€™s work reflects the influences that have inspired him. He studied Painting at the Slade with Euan Uglow and Bruce Mclean - apparent in the dynamic energy and sheer celebration of colour that Irvine achieves in his compositions.

  George Irvine works from his studio at home in Oxfordshire. He teaches Fine Art at Stowe School where, this year, his students achieved the best results for Art in the country.
