  ***JEFF CLARKE : CHIAROSCURO : Prints, Drawings and Etchings ***


  ***Carey Blyth Gallery &nbsp;***


  ***September 2020***


  *‘Chairoscuro’ translates literally to ‘light-dark’.&nbsp; It is a technique
  that originated in Italy in the 1600s, initially in woodcuts by Ugo da Carpi,
  to create both form and drama.*


  *The technique was developed fully through the 1600s by artists such as
  Leonardo da Vinci, Rembrandt and Vermeer.&nbsp; One of its strongest exponents
  was Caravaggio. His iconic paintings such as ‘The Calling of St Matthew’
  (1600), ‘The Entombment of Christ’ (1503) and ‘Bacchus’ (1593) used light and
  dark to heighten dramatic effect. *


  *Caravaggio’s personal life was as dramatic as his paintings.&nbsp; He was a
  fighter, easily provoked and provocative, often involved in brawls. He was
  convicted of murder, but also lauded by the highest. At times he had to flee
  for his life.&nbsp; He sought a papal pardon but died prematurely in middle
  years at 39 whilst travelling, and it is unknown whether he was murdered, died
  of fever, or indeed of lead poisoning.*


  *Contrasting light and dark to create drama and mood, Chiaroscuro has been
  used by artists for over four hundred years across different media to include
  painting, drawing, etchings and photography ……… Chiaroscuro at its most
  dramatic, known as tenebrism, was Caravaggio’s legacy to artists known as the
  ‘tenebrisi’ who favoured his methodology.*


  *Piranesi, Architect and Engraver, (1720-28) is renowned for his beautiful
  etchings of the ‘Ruins of Rome’ and the ‘Carceri’.&nbsp; Through exaggerated
  scale, perspective and Chiaroscuro, he captured the theatre of a fallen
  empire, peopled with figures dwarfed by edifices.&nbsp; The drama is
  heightened by trapeziums of light streaming between pillars and open-skied
  complex constructions, spotlighting the tableaux beneath.*


  *Four centuries on from Piranesi, in Bologna, painter and etcher Georgio
  Morandi underlined this with a quieter conversation in flatter terms of tonal
  subtlety, using local landscape and studio paraphernalia rather than figures.
  Clearly Morandi and Piranesi are much-loved mentors and muses to Jeff Clarke.*


  ***Jeff Clarke : “Composer Herbert Howells said* ‘*the themes which work best,
  are those that choose you’.*&nbsp;**


  ***Light and shade have certainly laid a long, exciting and often heavy hand
  over seventy of my eighty-five years.&nbsp; It’s a very old theme in Art
  History, ‘Chiaroscuro’ : surface vibration, time passing, metaphor, destra
  sinistra, &nbsp;or what you will.***


  ***Our radiant sun is a great gift, an absolute necessity, and it’s rising and
  falling does not depend on the stock exchange, or indeed art.&nbsp; We take it
  for granted at our peril….***


  ***Not exclusive by any means given the independence of line, and colour if
  required, but egged on by early years in the sunshine of Italy and Crete, I
  have been involved in recurrent bouts with light’s perpetual motions,
  life-giving angles and continually shifting shapes which develop into a chess
  game, a dialectic of illumination and camouflage full of apparent
  surprise.&nbsp; Working in places of classical and romantic history is a
  powerful stimulant, but my real job for a long time has been to try and
  capture some sense of the precious irradiation of the everyday”.***


  *Black and White*, is the backbone of Jeff Clarke’s practice.&nbsp; His skill
  is exploring the full spectrum betwixt the two, creating compositions that are
  flooded with light, where *nature morte* is brought to life.&nbsp;


  Initially when discussing this exhibition, Clarke was determined to exhibit
  prints, etchings and drawings in monochrome alone. &nbsp;Sixty years in the
  studio and a classical training has made its mark.&nbsp; His commitment to
  line and form in capturing the light is unrelenting, and the excitement of the
  challenge is evident in that gleam in his eye, and indeed in his work.&nbsp;
  Clarke describes the dialogue between light and dark a*s ‘inescapable in every
  sense’.*


  Working largely *sur le motif*, he juxtaposes jugs and pots of brushes on
  tabletops with fruit, perhaps apples or onions.&nbsp; Each day, the challenge
  is on - his mantra is to *elevate the everyday* through form and light.


  In ***Boxing and Shadows***, strident lines in ink and charcoal, delineate
  grocers’ boxes, an enamel jug and potted plant. Two apples roll into the
  foreground.&nbsp; A subtle sepia wash of the empty box interior in the
  background, and the skin of the apple in the foreground, opens up the space.
  Clarke’s triumph of *Chiaroscuro* is complete. His composition is sublime,
  infused with the nuances and inflections of dancing light, defining form.


  Clarke is a Master Printmaker of decades.&nbsp; He attended Art School in the
  early 1950s and considers himself fortunate to have been taught by George
  Hooper, and Raymond Cowern who emerged from the Royal College of Art during
  the etching boom in the 1930s.&nbsp; Following in Cowern’s footsteps, Clarke
  was awarded the Prix de Rome in Engraving, spending two years in Italy, and
  thus began a lifetime’s exchange with the Mediterranean.


  For more than sixty years, Jeff Clarke has been travelling to France and Italy
  for the crisp light of Spring and the softer tones of the Autumn.&nbsp; In the
  80’s he made regular visits to Crete as draughtsman to the British School of
  Archaeology recording antiquities and relics such as Minoan pots unearthed at
  Knossos.&nbsp; The history and discipline of the classical is woven into the
  fabric of his practice.


  Perfecting his form, he would have been working in that singularly harsh and
  striking light that sets Crete apart and reminds us that geographically it is
  as close to the Middle East and North Africa as it is to Western Europe.
  Distinct from the softer light of Italy or the Auvergne, the sun in Crete -
  like the screaming of the cicadas during siesta - is unrelenting, casting
  clean lines and dark shadows that contrast strongly with a sun bleached
  landscape. It is these extremes and polarities of light that characterize
  Clarke’s work.


  Over years of sun-saturated days working *en plein air,* Clarke has built an
  extensive portfolio of etchings, prints and drawings capturing the roof tops
  of small, unassuming French towns, shutters closed in the afternoon heat, the
  quiet of deserted side streets. But as drawn as he has been to the timeless
  beauty and romance of France and Italy, so he has been captivated by the raw,
  brittle landscape across Crete and Greece where houses are ever yet to be
  completed, workmans’ trucks loaded with the detritus of construction straddle
  the verge, the chaos of wires above ground, distinct and scratchy, contrasting
  with giant cactus and ancient olive trees that spill over dusty walls.


  Working from his home and studio at Folly Bridge, Clarke carries his
  observations of the Mediterranean light to the Oxford suburbs. Location is
  secondary. &nbsp;The intensity of his work is matched across all subjects and
  media, whether it is washing on the line across the backyard terraces beyond
  Folly Bridge, or an empty chair in a quiet corner of a Knossos garden,
  classically composed, the afternoon light stretching across the late
  afternoon. All is expressed in simple black and white.


  The purist in Jeff Clarke would challenge me, but I maintain a quiet shout for
  colour because Jeff Clarke’s attention and intense study of monochrome over
  sixty years has rendered him master of both.&nbsp; His coloured etchings,
  hand-coloured drawings and collages speak for themselves. They are a total
  delight.
