  **ROSE-MARIE CALDECOTT at Carey Blyth Gallery 8 Woodstock Road OX2 6HT
  (wed-sun 11-5 pm)**


  **November-December 2019**


  Painted *sur le motif, en plein air*, Caldecott is captivated by the beauty of
  the Oxfordshire landscape that surrounds her. The Cotswolds, beloved by so
  many, appear richly farmed bestowing a bucolic sense of peace and order.&nbsp;
  Yet these compositions bear witness to the contradictions that rumble beneath
  our feet…&nbsp;


  Most wildlife emerges at dusk avoiding the harsh reality of our presence on
  the land.&nbsp; Thus in daytime the fields appear bare, bar the plethora of
  pheasants reared for the pot.&nbsp; At dusk however, the deer, hare and
  badgers come out to drink, to hunt and feed, at one with the natural rhythm of
  the earth. That diurnal/nocturnal dynamic of polarisation is played out by
  Caldecott in many ways across her canvas.&nbsp; Abstraction and figuration
  echo the extremes that run through her paintings. The sky, unruly and
  ever-changing, threatens above fields that are regimented and manicured.
  Verges, hedges and tree lines run wild between oversized fields that are
  primed for harvest, at odds with her silver-nitrate clouds that remind us of
  the unfettered power of nature.&nbsp; However hard we try to tame and contain
  it, it will have the last word determining the success of the harvest.&nbsp;
  The land may be tamed but the weather and the climate cannot be controlled.


  Fractal patterning has been a feature of Caldecott’s landscape painting for
  some years now.&nbsp; Observed in the minutiae of lichen, the branching of
  coral and trees, fractal patterning occurs from micro to macro observed from
  satellite in the patterning of shorelines and river deltas across the planet.


  In her Trinity series, Caldecott has employed the golden rectangle – so
  satisfying to our eye.&nbsp; Each portal is a golden rectangle in its own
  right and her act of framing echoes for her the parameters that we set to deal
  with the challenges that life throws at us.&nbsp; Life is a balancing act for
  mind, body and soul.&nbsp; There is a beginning, middle and end, and
  ultimately a holy trinity.


  &nbsp;


  ***Rose-Marie Caldecott&nbsp; : ‘Creating these paintings reminds me that
  underneath every decision I make, every action I undertake, lies the reality
  of something I can’t entirely plan for. Nothing we do sits in isolation, all
  things are connected; and all things are subject to change. I hope that my
  paintings remind the viewer that they need not always flee from this truth, by
  accepting it fearlessly, one can discover the heart of beauty.’***

  THE MAGIC OF THE TREES


  11 FEBRUARY - 13 MARCH 2015


  Rose-Marie Caldecott's work explores the relationship between patterns in
  nature and humanity’s ordering instinct - the endeavour that man makes to
  establish stability and constancy within the ever-fluctuating reality that we
  are bound to.


  During her degree at Falmouth University (2011-2014), she was drawn towards
  the theme of gardens, a topic that continues to inform her practice. Exploring
  the correlation between painter and gardener, her interests have for the last
  few years looked at the debate between the formal gardens, such as Versailles,
  and more informal romantic styles. Rosie has gravitated strongly towards
  18<sup>th</sup> Century English landscape gardens, particularly those
  conceived and created by Capability Brown, at Blenheim and across the UK. For
  her, they perfectly articulate the strange dichotomy between our desire to
  leave nature untouched in all her splendour, and to compose her into that
  which can be better understood, viewed and inhabited.


  Rose-Marie Caldecott returns to Art Jericho's "Magic of The Trees" with an
  interim show complementing the exhibition that she is taking part in at The
  Palace Gallery,yes" Blenheim titled 'Blenheim in a New Light' (13 Feb - 2
  May).yes"

  The Radiance of Being


  **1 - 31 August 2014**


  **Art Jericho : 6 King Street Oxford OX2 6DF**


  ***"All my work is essentially rooted in the human experience of reconciling
  ourselves to a surrendering of control. In allowing the medium of print or
  paint more freedom to react and compose organically, I wish to encourage the
  viewer to recognize the beauty and meaning that can be born out of letting
  go".***


  Rose-Marie Caldecott graduated from Falmouth College of Art this year with a
  First Class Degree in Fine Art. She is a recent Saatchi Sensation Nominee and
  this is her first one man exhibition at Art Jericho from 1 - 31 August.


  Rose-Marie's work appears to hang in the ether. Her preoccupation is that
  space between what is designed and orchestrated viz-a-viz nature unfettered.
  Her compositions are a magical blend of the two, which although polarised,
  marry together to create a sense of 'other worldliness'.


  Whilst contemplating the metaphysics of reality, Caldecott has also been
  exploring the process of letting go, observing the occurrence of fractals in
  nature - those self similar patterns that reoccur whether in the formation of
  clouds, trees and plants, crystals or shells. On canvas, that has translated
  to the artist allowing the paint to find its place on the page, and composing
  that natural occurence together with fine draftmanship.


  The motifs she uses to infer man's interference with nature, range from paths
  through the woods, to the neo-romantic folly above that was so very
  characteristic of 18th Century landscaped gardens. In her prints, she has
  included greenhouses as an expression of our attempts to capture an idealised
  form of nature.
