  ### ROSE-MARIE CALDECOTT

  THE MAGIC OF THE TREES

  11 FEBRUARY - 13 MARCH 2015

  Rose-Marie Caldecott's work explores the relationship between patterns in nature and humanityâ€™s ordering instinct - the endeavour that man makes to establish stability and constancy within the ever-fluctuating reality that we are bound to.

  During her degree at Falmouth University (2011-2014), she was drawn towards the theme of gardens, a topic that continues to inform her practice. Exploring the correlation between painter and gardener, her interests have for the last few years looked at the debate between the formal gardens, such as Versailles, and more informal romantic styles. Rosie has gravitated strongly towards 18<sup>th</sup> Century English landscape gardens, particularly those conceived and created by Capability Brown, at Blenheim and across the UK. For her, they perfectly articulate the strange dichotomy between our desire to leave nature untouched in all her splendour, and to compose her into that which can be better understood, viewed and inhabited.

  Rose-Marie Caldecott returns to Art Jericho's "Magic of The Trees" with an interim show complementing the exhibition that she is taking part in at The Palace Gallery,yes" Blenheim titled 'Blenheim in a New Light' (13 Feb - 2 May).yes"

  The Radiance of Being

  **1 - 31 August 2014**

  **Art Jericho : 6 King Street Oxford OX2 6DF**

  **_"All my work is essentially rooted in the human experience of reconciling ourselves to a surrendering of control. In allowing the medium of print or paint more freedom to react and compose organically, I wish to encourage the viewer to recognize the beauty and meaning that can be born out of letting go"._**

  Rose-Marie Caldecott graduated from Falmouth College of Art this year with a First Class Degree in Fine Art. She is a recent Saatchi Sensation Nominee and this is her first one man exhibition at Art Jericho from 1 - 31 August.

  Rose-Marie's work appears to hang in the ether. Her preoccupation is that space between what is designed and orchestrated viz-a-viz nature unfettered. Her compositions are a magical blend of the two, which although polarised, marry together to create a sense of 'other worldliness'.

  Whilst contemplating the metaphysics of reality, Caldecott has also been exploring the process of letting go, observing the occurrence of fractals in nature - those self similar patterns that reoccur whether in the formation of clouds, trees and plants, crystals or shells. On canvas, that has translated to the artist allowing the paint to find its place on the page, and composing that natural occurence together with fine draftmanship.

  The motifs she uses to infer man's interference with nature, range from paths through the woods, to the neo-romantic folly above that was so very characteristic of 18th Century landscaped gardens. In her prints, she has included greenhouses as an expression of our attempts to capture an idealised form of nature.
