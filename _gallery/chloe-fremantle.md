  ### ***Forthcoming* : Chloe Fremantle & Peter Blegvad**


  ### **'Light Seeking Light'&nbsp; &nbsp;: 1-12 November 2022&nbsp;**


  ### **Royal Watercolour Society Galleries**


  ### **3-5 Whitcomb Street London WC2H&nbsp; 7HA**


  ### **​​​​Tuesday-Saturday 10-5 pm**


  ***‘Colour and I are one.&nbsp; I am a painter’ Paul Klee***


  Colour influences our perceptions, affecting our behaviour and our moods
  whilst our brains seek out patterns to help us assess and predict. Colour and
  patterning have been core to our survival since humanity began, and Art ‘manna
  for the soul’. From the Ancient Egyptians who used prisms to split the colours
  from crystals for medicinal purpose and to enhance wellbeing, to Carl Jung who
  said that ‘colours are the mother tongue of the subconscious’, clearly palette
  colours the mind.&nbsp; For Artists, it is a path to liberation.


  Chloe Fremantle: ***‘Evocations'&nbsp;*reflect the fleetingness of our
  memories, and the wealth of individual experience which inform our responses
  to any given moment’.**


  Artists share with us their unique journeys through observation and expression
  across a limitless spectrum of creativity in varying degrees of figuration and
  abstraction, from the keenest depictions of realism to the dream realms of
  Colour Field painting. It is the artists of the 1930s and 40s who have been
  the most influential for Chloe Fremantle with artists such as Paul Nash,
  Graham Sutherland, Patrick Heron, Eileen Agar, Helen Frankenthaler as well as
  Henri Matisse, Braque and Picasso, clearly her muses.


  There is an innate sense of joy in Chloe Fremantle’s painting irrespective of
  her subject.&nbsp; Such is the effect of colour and patterning in her work for
  us as viewers.&nbsp; On close inspection one can unravel her language of
  mark-making that she has developed from observations of the natural world and
  her immediate environment.&nbsp;


  High up in the Alpes Maritimes, close to a much-loved pied-a-terre on the Cote
  d’Azur, is a beautiful cemetery that pans out over the Mediterranean
  below.&nbsp; Chloe’s ***Memento Mori in Black and Gold*** explores the curve
  and line of stonework and trellis, interspersed with the adornments particular
  to catholic French graveyards, and the flowers and succulents that flourish
  there.&nbsp;


  Urbanity and politics do not go unnoticed.&nbsp; Her
  ***Contemplation*&nbsp;&nbsp;**series celebrates diversity whilst reflecting
  on the seemingly unreconcilable stand-off arising from Brexit. Lockdown during
  Covid, highlighted the nuances of ***Home Sweet Home,*** contrasting with
  Chloe’s explorations of space - the ‘out’ from ‘within’.&nbsp;


  Seeds, pods and petals of myriad flora observed, inform her mark-making and
  are complemented by the micro of biology and cellular structure, to the macro
  of curves and contouring in the landscape.&nbsp; All of this is academic
  because she has over years created her own alphabet and language that has a
  life of its own.&nbsp; It is instantly recognisable and distinctly Fremantle
  in both palette and form.&nbsp; Memories and emotions through association
  pervade her compositions so that the initial delight that one enjoys on first
  inspection is challenged as we explore the complexities of her compositions.
  The overall effect is a ‘jazz fusion’ of balance on the canvas, the product of
  a life time of painting.&nbsp;

  ### 'REFLECTIONS'


  **ART JERICHO 4 June - 5 July 2015**


  Chloe Fremantle has clearly found her signature - her compositions appear to
  come easily. Yet work that falls easy on the page is so often hard won, and
  Chloe has been observing and composing her art with endeavour and increasing
  delight for some decades.


  Reflections includes artist response to gardens, to urban London scenes, to
  remote rural Northumberland landscapes and to a hill village in the South Of
  France & Oxford University Botanic Garden in acrylic on canvas and gouache on
  watercolour paper, small, medium and large.


  ### MUSE IN THE GARDEN : March - May 2013


  The Gallery, Oxford Botanic Garden curated by Jenny Blyth Fine Art


  For the past year Chloe Fremantle, contemporary artist, has been observing the
  Oxford Botanic Gardens. Her paintings inhabit ambivalence, ‘visual haikus’,
  suspended between abstraction and figuration. Capturing the essence of the
  seasons as freshly dug earth transforms to summer flower-filled borders, seed
  pods, petals, leaves, stems and bark are captured in all their glorious colour
  and myriad patterns. The artist combines her depiction of flora with an
  element of topography to reflect the layout of the gardens, and a backcloth of
  distinctive sandstone walls. Essentially, Chloe Fremantle has been exploring
  flora for thirty years, celebrating nature and the miracle of its unending
  beauty.


  ### CHLOE FREMANTLE & TAEKO MAKINO


  **SUMMER HAIKU at ART JERICHO**


  **23 July – 27 August 2011**


  Jenny Blyth Fine Art at Art Jericho presents SUMMER HAIKU, an exhibition of
  paintings by CHLOE FREMANTLE and wood engravings by TAEKO MAKINO to celebrate
  the glory of summer at Art Jericho.


  Chloe Fremantle explores the rhythm and pattern of nature inherent in
  feathers, petals, waves, splashes, leaves, flowers, seeds, trees, tracks,
  contours, spirals, curves, clouds and circles….. In the spirit of ‘visual’
  Haiku, the artist uses her observation of simple elements in the natural world
  to impart a symbolic interpretation of universality, constraint, stillness,
  energy, movement, peace, freedom, chaos, imagination, beauty, endurance,
  strength and empathy. Delighted by the repetitions, the infinite variety, the
  colour and play of pattern irrespective of form, her recent paintings in oil
  on canvas abstract to unexpected landscape. Chloe Fremantle trained in Fine
  Art at Byam Shaw School of Art in London in 1968. She has been painting for
  forty years living in Italy, New York and London where she has been based
  since 1987.


  Taeko Makino’s exquisite wood engravings of peonies, camellias, chrysanthemums
  inlaid with gilt draw directly on Japanese tradition of fine art. The artist
  lives and works in Tokyo.
