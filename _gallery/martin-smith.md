  **Currently showing at CAREY BLYTH 8 Woodstock Road OX2 6HT**


  Martin Smith is showing ***Leda and the Swan, Autothonces, Cycladic Figure,
  Shrine*** and ***Ground Swell.&nbsp;***


  &nbsp;<br>***Leda and the Swa***n embodies Greek Mythology which is at the
  heart of much of Smith's sculptural narrative.&nbsp; Zeus, besotted by Leda,
  transformed himself into a swan to seduce her.&nbsp; Zeus fathered two
  children with Leda - to include Helen of Troy. *\*\*Autothonces \*\**embodies
  the origins of man in ancient greek mythology where 'adam and eve' are borne
  of the earth and rise out of the earth…. In both these sculptures, Smith's
  figures are entwined, carved from alabaster and are as one.

  TOUCHING THE EARTH&nbsp;


  Sculpture by MARTIN SMITH and Paintings by ADDY GARDNER


  7 MAY - 1 JUNE 2019


  Curated by Jenny Blyth


  North Wall Arts Centre, South Parade, Summertown, Oxford OX2 7JN


  ***Touching The Earth&nbsp;***marks the moment where these two artists meet -
  a point of balance where the intangible meets substance.&nbsp; Both artists
  delight in the earthiness of an organic sense of form whilst celebrating an
  ethereal ambivalence.&nbsp;


  When talking about sculpture, **Martin Smith** enthuses about jazz with equal
  passion. Transported by iconic trumpeters and saxophonists from Miles Davis to
  Ben Webster, he describes an alchemy of easy liberation where music,
  mellifluous and light, ‘comes through them like breath’, and how that process
  of synesthesia for him is expressed through sculpture, ‘the breath of stone’.
  &nbsp;Patterns of sound and shape are transposed, so that the language of
  marble and alabaster is alchemized into sculpture. &nbsp; The beauty of
  Smith’s chosen stone is in the degree of opacity and tone, ranging from the
  deep brown agate alabasters of *Touching The Earth*, to the rare and
  translucent Volterra ivories of *Lock Stones* that are soft to the touch and
  warm when lit from behind.


  **Addy Gardner** studied Psychology before committing to Fine Art twenty years
  ago.&nbsp; Her genre is abstracted landscape, popular with landscape painters
  but Gardner distinguishes her work through an experiential journey that
  reflects the scene before her, entwined with memories and thoughts evoked by
  the beauty she finds in the landscape. ‘Peak Experience’ has been her goal,
  and that moment of ‘ah-ness’ the pivotal point for her compositions.&nbsp;
  Drawing inspiration from the landscape of the Windrush Valley and woodlands,
  her work is about her life and relationships – historical, and of the moment.


  Addy Gardner’s collection of new paintings marks a departure from safer
  territory that she knows works well for her, towards fresh pastures and new
  horizons, a journey that every painter must make.&nbsp; This makes for
  exciting viewing for us as we share her journey and spirit of adventure.

  THE ART OF MUSIC & LANGUAGE


  Drawings of West Coast of Scotland by CLAIRE CHRISTIE SADLER


  Fruits of the Earth, Sculpture by MARTIN SMITH\*


  Until 16 October 2016


  **Martin Smith**, sculptor, studied French and German at Queen’s College,
  Oxford. He taught himself German in early years before taking it up at school
  where he also studied Russian. He wrote his doctorate on Machiavelli and
  Rousseau, and has worked for many years as editor at the Voltaire Foundation
  in Oxford. He has always been fascinated and delighted by language, and
  therein lies the key to his metamorphosis from Academic to Sculptor - the
  teasing of language out of stone.


  A love of Italy and the Mediterranean - evenings spent under olive trees
  supping simple wines and food - is core to the artist’s wellbeing. He is able
  to happily knit the intellect of Oxford with annual trips to Tuscany to source
  marble, and attend residencies at the Centro d’Arte Verrocchio in Casole
  d’Elsa to secure quiet, focussed time.


  The words that Smith uses to describe his sculpture are ‘Fruits of the Earth’
  - desire, flames, bubbling water, fountains…. His work is both ethereal and
  organic, talkative, sensual, abstracted, his subjects ranging from clouds,
  flames and wings, to seeds, buds and pods, that as in nature are often
  explicit in gender.


  Carrara marble - white with grey ripples, *bianco venatino macchiato di oro* -
  white marble with small golden veins, agate alabaster that is milky in opacity
  - Smith lingers lovingly over both language and stone. His conversation with
  the stone is a process of exacting from its essence the image that he has in
  his mind’s eye. The stone, depending on the changing composition inherent in,
  say Rajasthan marble, will resist or comply, inspiring fresh thought and
  challenge. It is a shared dialogue.


  At odds with the sensuality of his sculpture is a fully functioning studio in
  his Oxford garden. As you enter you are confronted with the reality of
  sculpting - the sheer physicality that stone demands - the detritus of
  stonemasonry - power tools, drills and grinders, face masks and thick white
  powdered marble that blankets every surface. And out of this, the butterfly
  emerges.
