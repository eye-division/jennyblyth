  Food, storytelling and myths are at the heart of Anne Lynch’s paintings.&nbsp;
  Working in watercolour and occasional collage, she defies the traditional
  parameters of scale and content of her chosen medium. &nbsp; Although tutored
  by Elizabeth Blackadder, her work is more wild than pretty, nor is she drawn
  to the romance of landscape. Woodlands may entice her, but as a place to hide,
  or to protect her.&nbsp; Trees feature in her paintings because she enjoys the
  dancing silhouettes of maritime pines that spangle the Charantes Maritime
  coast where she has a home and studio.&nbsp; Dividing her time between UK and
  France, *joie de vivre* is a phrase that comes naturally to her.


  Food, particularly the French rituals that surround the sharing of food, is
  centre stage in much of her work where women gossip as they lay the tables,
  and guests delight in food and company in equal measure. A Francophile of many
  years, AL has been inspired by medieval paintings in ecclesiastic settings of
  *norms alimentaires du Moyen Age,* where the women often ate without the men.
  Her paintings ***Secret Yet to be Heard*** and ***Patience and Mischief*** are
  staged in the nearby 11th Century Abbaye de Fontdouce, and are indeed infused
  with piquant, secret exchange and mischief.


  AL’s father was Jewish and her mother Irish Catholic. She says that
  nationality and culture cannot be separated. &nbsp;Her parents ran a 1950s
  hotel, and as a child, she found herself, despite the bustle of unending
  catering, ‘bizarrely’ lonely, running up and down long hotel corridors. One
  can appreciate how she is drawn to the warmth of the Gallic approach.&nbsp;
  &nbsp;Her work exudes a spirit of joy and generosity yet there is a pervading
  sense of ‘*lost in a fairytale’* that inhabits her work.&nbsp; She speaks of
  ‘windows of escape, and clarity’.


  ‘Soul Jars’ or Vessels that house spirits have recurred in the mythology of
  different cultures across millenia, and ‘pots of plenty’ particularly, are
  part of AL’s painting language where you will find eyes peering out from
  within.&nbsp; The ancient Sanskrit word for ‘pot’ means body, and has been
  used widely in Indian art and literature to mean woman, earth, bounty, womb
  and plentitude, and such is the inference in her compositions.


  Botanics feature strongly in her narrative with outsized sunflowers reminding
  us of *Jack and the Beanstalk,* beckoning to be climbed, and the glorious
  sunflower fields of Le Midi that turn their faces to follow the sun through
  the day.&nbsp; Elizabeth Blackadder often placed her chosen subject physically
  on the page, building her composition around it, and AL has used that
  technique to construct her botanical paintings, exploring the page outwards
  from a central flower which she describes as a body response to composition.
