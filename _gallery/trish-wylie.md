  **‘ALL THE PRETTY HORSES’**


  Text by Jenny Blyth, Curator & Gallerist


  Trish Wylie, originally from Stockwell, is a Londoner through and through, a
  painter with a love of horses and Westerns.&nbsp; Although she abandoned
  London for West Bay on the Dorset coast to raise a young family, she returned
  in 2010 to the hustle and bustle of the city at 53 years of age with two
  daughters, settling happily in Shepherd’s Bush. Strange then, one might
  suppose, for a city girl to have such a profound love of horses, and more so
  Westerns. &nbsp;Her studio desk space is studded with prints of horses - Film
  Stills, traced, drawn and washed in inks… Her paintings have a cinematic
  sensibility – cool and glamorous, with strong lines and flat planes of colour
  in oil on canvas. The reds, blacks and purples are unapologetic, and lend an
  immediacy we associate with Pop Art.&nbsp;


  True, that as a child of the 60s & 70s she grew up on a diet of TV Westerns.
  TW was and remains, a tomboy. One of a gang with older brothers, she recalls
  clambering over corrugated sheet metal fences.&nbsp; Games such as *Stallions*
  were of their imagination, their roles influenced by the idealised heroics of
  cowboys on the Frontier borderlands that inspired the Westerns that they
  loved.&nbsp; *The* *Magnificent Seven*, *How The West Was Won, The Misfits*
  and Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone are amongst her favourites, and
  inspiration for **All The Pretty Horses**. But more particularly, her father
  made harnesses for the working horses that turned the trains and delivered
  goods at Camden.&nbsp; She recalls, as a child, the sound of horses kicking
  stable doors of a morning. Her parents had run away together from Ireland
  where her father was employed as a Saddler for Trish’s grandfather.&nbsp; So
  for Trish, as for her parents and grandparents, horses are in the blood.&nbsp;


  Perhaps it was those early years where she first wisted after the adventure
  and heroics of the characters that now fuel her paintings.&nbsp; Gender
  precluded but informed her mind’s eye. Born into an Irish Catholic family, one
  of ten siblings born in quick succession, she describes her mother as
  ‘powerless, without control’. &nbsp;TW’s palette reflects her thoughts,
  reversing archetypal gender colour assumptions as she transposes blues with
  pinks. &nbsp;**Sisters I & II**, in red and pink on black, originated from
  police horses she observed on parade in Holland Park - male horses in reality
  that she has infused with motifs of leaping horses she discovered at the
  Design Museum. &nbsp; Assigning female gender, TW has caught the unbridled
  energy of young male horses, jostling for position as they run together.
  Effectively she has released them back to the wild on canvas - young stallions
  in the making.


  TW studied Fine Art at Camberwell School of Art incorporating film and
  psychology, specifically crime and punishment, into her chosen modules.
  &nbsp;John Sturges’ *Magnificent Seven* inspired by Akira Kurosawa’s *Seven
  Samurai* is core to TW’s new work such as **Desert Cowboys**. &nbsp;AK drew on
  a lifetime study of drama from Shakespeare to Dosteovsky when creating his
  films.&nbsp; The severity of action and consequence in plots from *King Lear*
  to *Crime & Punishment* resonated with codes of honour prescribed for Samurai
  warriors - Japan had long been forbidden access to Western culture,
  particularly American Westerns, so in effect AK created a Japanese Western. In
  TWs linocuts of *The Magnificent Seven,* vertical streaks etched into the
  surface of the linoleum emulate the rain as the riders are carried forward by
  their horses running together shoulder to shoulder.


  In 2019, TW spent six weeks on the West Coast of California, and ten days in
  the Mojave Desert in a mobile home, alone.&nbsp; Brutal in the summer months,
  and too hot to sustain horses with only 3-5 inches of rain a year, the desert
  was once a hideaway for outlaws and hunting ground for posses. Home to *Death
  Valley* and *Furnace Creek* with temperatures the hottest recorded on Earth at
  over 56 degrees, homesteaders and pioneers died crossing the desert in their
  quest for gold, or to make a new life in California.&nbsp; The southern region
  of the Mojave Desert is straddled by the Joshua Tree National Park named after
  the succulent Joshua Trees pollinated by yucca moths, but wildlife, prescribed
  by the harshest of terrains and climate, ranges from scorpions and snakes to
  road runners, jack rabbits and mountain lions. &nbsp; TW explored the Mojave
  in the Autumn, feeding the tones of the desert into her work.


  Whereas earlier paintings, scaled up from smaller collaged studies, featured
  the violent ‘heroism’ of adventure in the Wild West as glamorised by the film
  industry, TW’s most recent work steps away from the lawlessness of an untamed
  land where gun laws continue to define and determine behaviour.&nbsp; Her new
  paintings celebrate the spirit of freedom portrayed so beautifully in Cormac
  McCarthy’s Borderland Trilogy **All The Pretty Horses.** Identifying the
  riders simply by the brim and curl of their hats, the jangle of spurs and the
  squeeze of leather, the horses are the stars of the show – you can hear the
  thunder of their hooves, the sound of their breath and the speed as they run.
  Trish Wylie does not seek to recreate figurative semblance, more the spirit of
  the horses in the moment, their exuberance and primal energy. Rearing horses
  feature predominantly, wild creatures, at one with a wild land.
