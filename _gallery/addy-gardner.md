  *"My paintings are born from an emotional response to places I visit and views
  that I witness in my day to day life. Outwardly they relate to different light
  and colour in the landscape. I then relate these to inward feelings and
  memories and things which are currently going on in my life. Sometimes also
  the history of a place and a feeling about a place will have an effect on the
  painting. All of them are about beauty in the landscape and moments where this
  beauty affects us.”*


  Essentially Addy Gardner’s paintings are autobiographical, reflecting her
  thoughts and preoccupations which morph into compositions capturing the drama
  of darker moments and lighter dawns of realisation, a sense &nbsp;of self and
  'peak experience'.


  Abstract expressionism in Addy's work generally treads a fine line with
  figuration, as land meets sky, affording us an insight into the artist's
  journey whilst inviting us to explore our own path. This particular painting
  ***Along By The Willows, Deep In*** ***Thought*** &nbsp;is the artist’s
  response to walking by the River Windrush.&nbsp; Winter is receding and there
  is a promise of Spring and new beginnings.&nbsp; The willows are bare with
  whiplike branches but the light is cool and fresh against the greens and
  browns of the earth.


  Addy Gardner trained in Psychology before studying Fine Art, and it is the
  combination of the two that distinguishes her abstracted landscapes from so
  many others.


  MAY - JUNE 2019 : TOUCHING THE EARTH&nbsp;&nbsp;


  Paintings by **Addy Gardner** and Sculpture by **Martin Smith,** c*urated by
  Jenny Blyth at North Wall Arts Centre, Oxford*


  ***Touching The Earth&nbsp;***marks the moment where these two artists meet -
  a point of balance where the intangible meets substance.&nbsp; Both artists
  delight in the earthiness of an organic sense of form whilst celebrating an
  ethereal ambivalence.&nbsp;


  **Addy Gardner** studied Psychology before committing to Fine Art twenty years
  ago.&nbsp; Her genre is abstracted landscape, popular with landscape painters
  but Gardner distinguishes her work through an experiential journey that
  reflects the scene before her, entwined with memories and thoughts evoked by
  the beauty she finds in the landscape. ‘Peak Experience’ has been her goal,
  and that moment of ‘ah-ness’ the pivotal point for her compositions.&nbsp;
  Drawing inspiration from the landscape of the Windrush Valley and woodlands,
  her work is about her life and relationships – historical, and of the moment.


  Addy Gardner’s collection of new paintings marks a departure from safer
  territory that she knows works well for her, towards fresh pastures and new
  horizons, a journey that every painter must make.&nbsp; This makes for
  exciting viewing for us as we share her journey and spirit of adventure.


  When talking about sculpture, **Martin Smith** enthuses about jazz with equal
  passion.&nbsp; Transported by iconic trumpeters and saxophonists from Miles
  Davis to Ben Webster, he describes an alchemy of easy liberation where music,
  mellifluous and light, ‘*comes through them like breath’,* and how that
  process of synesthesia for him is expressed through sculpture, ‘*the breath of
  stone’*.&nbsp; Patterns of sound and shape are transposed, so that the
  language of marble and alabaster is alchemized into sculpture.&nbsp;


  The beauty of Smith’s chosen stone is in the degree of opacity and tone,
  ranging from the deep brown agate alabasters of *Touching the Earth,* to the
  rare and translucent Volterra ivories of *Lock Stones* that are soft to the
  touch and warm when lit from behind.

  **SKYFALL : Paintings & Drawings by ADDY GARDNER** curated by Jenny Blyth Fine
  Art at Art Jericho, Oxford


  **DECEMBER 2016&nbsp;**


  Addy Gardner, Oxfordshire artist, trained in both Fine Art and Applied
  Psychology. Sixteen years ago she declined the offer of an MA in Fine Art and
  set off to Edinburgh where she set up her studio inspired by the beauty of
  Scottish landscape. She returned to Oxfordshire in 2004.


  For those of you who know her work, you will find that Addy has moved on from
  what you might expect. She is painting beautiful and complex landscapes
  composed of layers of oil paint which individually retain both substance and
  translucency. The effect is to capture the fluidity of the firmament -
  sunlight spilling through clouds, earth and sky bathed in luminosity. Her
  subject is the landscape that she encounters around her which she recreates in
  the studio as photographic panoramic ‘sketches’. From that visual reference
  point, Addy creates paintings that echo her memories, thoughts, dreams and
  emotions – moments of ‘peak experience’. There is a strong autobiographical
  element in her work that colours her compositions with titles such as “*The
  memory of the moment we first met*”. An artist invites us to share their
  journey, yet the success of a painting is also determined by their ability to
  invite us to make our own. Addy Gardner is chasing beauty, and is successful
  on both counts.


  JBFA showed Addy Gardner at London Art Fair in January 2013 and at Affordable
  Art Fair Battersea in October 2013.

  > The sublime is that which we cannot appropriate, if only because we cannot
  discern any boundaries. If anything, it appropriates us . . . Malcolm Andrews


  Moving seamlessly between configuration and abstract expressionism, Addy
  Gardner invites the viewer to journey between an earthly landscape and a
  canvas of dreams. Her painting aspires to ‘Peak Experience’ where the viewer
  releases their sense of self, to an awareness of a greater unity. Gardner
  commands an ability to create form, transforming the colours of earth and sky
  to a spectrum of light and ambivalence. Working in oil on canvas, Addy
  Gardner’s paintings are infused with vitality, imparting energy and a sense of
  joy.


  > My paintings draw on the tradition of the picturesque and sublime. They are
  a representation of the point at which beauty emerges in the natural world.
  Addy Gardner.
