  ### *THE CIRCUS IS COMING TO TOWN !*


  **24 NOVEMBER - 23 DECEMBER 2016**


  at ART JERICHO 6 King Street Oxford OX2 6DF


  Prints, Collage, Chine Collee, Etchings, Monotypes inspired by Gifford Circus
  (text & images below)


  The circus has delighted and astounded audiences since Phillip Astley, 'father
  of the modern circus', conjured up an extravaganza of horsemanship in 1760's.
  Nell and Toti's creation emerged from an Oxfordshire barn in the Cotswolds
  sixteen years ago. Gifford Circus has all the magic, the frissant of the
  unexpected, the humour, pathos and daring, the glamour and the glitter, to
  bedazzle us all - with extraordinary acts by dancers, acrobats, musicians,
  clowns, jugglers and beautiful horses set around themes such as The Wild West
  and War and Peace.


  As an artist, Carolyn Horton has been a devotee of Gifford Circus returning
  repeatedly to savour each season since its inception… and she is not alone.
  For 250 years since the earliest circuses emerged, artists such as Chagall,
  Degas, and Toulouse-Lautrec have been inspired to capture the drama of the
  acts that have beguiled them. Georges Seurat's final painting The Circus, 1891
  was made at a time when there were no less than five circuses performing
  regularly in Paris, such was demand.


  Horton is an artist specialising in printmaking, drawing and painting, and
  master paper restorer of Old Master drawings. Her world is paper - from
  hand-dyed, as fine as gossamer, to hand-made, with weight and texture. Pegged
  up in the studio, paper sheets hang like exotic laundry - richly coloured with
  patterns 'lifted' from surfaces such as old scoured printing plates - spotted
  and spangled to recreate the sawdust of the ring, the shimmer of an
  over-skirt, the speckledy-hen feathers of a chicken.


  Composing her narrative from a m&ecirc;l&eacute;e of chosen themes from the
  past 16 years, Horton weaves together tableaux that combine different elements
  of stage, dress and performance. The printing process she has developed is
  unique and labour intensive - her attention to detail immaculate, not
  surprising given her trade of almost forty years in restoration. She sketches
  first, then creates hard and soft ground etchings and chine coll&eacute; that
  she scalpels out and collages onto canvases lined with Japanese kozo paper.


  The overall effect is glorious. Carolyn Horton's canvases of the circus are
  stunning, a visual treat of horsemen galloping round the ring, musicians in
  top hats, girls in exquisite costumes with doves, jugglers and acrobats teamed
  and focussed, and the art, charm and wit of exchange between players. In
  short, Horton captures the 'frissant' that makes the circus irresistible to us
  all. &copy; Jenny Blyth 2018.

  ### LONG DOGS & LINGERIE


  &nbsp;FEBRUARY 2010&nbsp; The Gallery in Cork Street London W1 and


  8 APRIL – 1 MAY 2010 ART JERICHO, OXFORD.


  Jenny Blyth showing new work by CAROLYN HORTON at The Gallery in Cork Street
  London W1&nbsp; and Art Jericho, Oxford,


  Carolyn Horton’s experience has given her the authority to extend the medium
  of printmaking in new and uncharted directions…. The result is an
  extraordinary marriage of observation and imagination’ Norman Ackroyd R. A.
  1997&nbsp;


  CAROLYN HORTON creates an intimate world of paper that springs from her
  personal life, experience and surroundings. Drawing on thirty years of
  drawing, printmaking and conservation, working with Old Master Prints and
  Drawings from Perugino to Picasso, she has stepped across from the invisible
  world of restoration to create her own work.


  Horse hair mattresses and sofas are upholstered in Japanese Kozo paper
  providing ‘canvases’ for her contemporary collage. Curled up, or languishing
  amongst discarded dressing gowns, long dogs capture a moment in the day.
  Drawing on her love of the classical and an enjoyment of theatre, Horton
  prints onto hand-coloured paper composing a m&eacute;lange of whippets, silk
  stockings and camisoles that are strewn across beds and trail over armchairs
  and screens. Delicate chine coll&eacute;e prints are pasted onto canvases to
  create compositions that are unique and beautifully executed.


  A graduate of Advance Printmaking at Central St. Martin’s (1991-2) and Fine
  Art and Printmaking at Cheltenham College of Art (2001-4), Carolyn Horton was
  awarded an EEC Scholarship for Fresco Painting in Venice (1983) and the Prix
  de Rome at the French Academy for Conservation and Printmaking (1987-88). She
  worked in Florence, Oxford and Paris at The Uffizzi, The Bodleian and The
  Louvre, and in California she studied conservation of Old Masters working with
  an array of Japanese paper, under the pupillage of Keido Keyes. She now lives
  and works from her studio in Gloucestershire.
