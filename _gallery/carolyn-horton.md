  ### CAROLYN HORTON showing at The Louvre, Paris


  at Carrousel du Louvre, Salle Le Notre, 99 rue de Rivoli, 75001 Paris


  **13- 16 DECEMBER 2018**


  **Private View:&nbsp; Jeudi 13 decembre 18.00 pm**


  Carolyn Horton is an artist specialising in printmaking, drawing and painting,
  and master paper restorer of Old Master works of art on paper. Her world is
  paper - from hand-dyed, ‘Gampi’, as fine as gossamer, to hand-made, with
  weight and texture. Pegged up in the studio, paper sheets hang like exotic
  laundry - richly coloured with patterns ‘lifted’ from surfaces such as old
  scoured printing plates - spotted and spangled to recreate the sawdust of the
  circus ring, the shimmer of an over-skirt, the speckledy-hen feathers of a
  chicken.


  Composing her narrative from a m&ecirc;lée of chosen themes from the past 16
  years, Horton weaves together tableaux that combine different elements of
  stage, dress and performance. The printing process she has developed is unique
  and labour intensive - her attention to detail immaculate, not surprising
  given her trade of forty years in restoration.


  Horton first sketches her images onto tracing paper.&nbsp; Then uses the
  monotype (one off) technique by inking up a flat copper plate and re-drawing
  through the paper onto the rolled out black ink.&nbsp; This is wiped off
  leaving only the desired image. Colour is introduced with added chine collee
  as the plate is run through the press. Other preferred techniques are dry
  point engraving, hard and soft ground etching, again with chine collé that she
  scalpels out and collages onto canvases lined with Japanese Kozo paper.


  ### THE CIRCUS IS COMING TO TOWN&nbsp;


  **NOVEMBER - DECEMBER 2016**


  JBFA at ART JERICHO 6 King Street Oxford OX2 6DF


  Prints, Collage, Chine Collee, Etchings, Monotypes inspired by Gifford
  Circus.&nbsp;


  The circus has delighted and astounded audiences since Phillip Astley, 'father
  of the modern circus', conjured up an extravaganza of horsemanship in 1760's.
  Nell and Toti's creation emerged from an Oxfordshire barn in the Cotswolds
  sixteen years ago. Gifford Circus has all the magic, the frissant of the
  unexpected, the humour, pathos and daring, the glamour and the glitter, to
  bedazzle us all - with extraordinary acts by dancers, acrobats, musicians,
  clowns, jugglers and beautiful horses set around themes such as The Wild West
  and War and Peace.


  As an artist, Carolyn Horton has been a devotee of Gifford Circus returning
  repeatedly to savour each season since its inception… and she is not alone.
  For 250 years since the earliest circuses emerged, artists such as Chagall,
  Degas, and Toulouse-Lautrec have been inspired to capture the drama of the
  acts that have beguiled them. Georges Seurat's final painting The Circus, 1891
  was made at a time when there were no less than five circuses performing
  regularly in Paris, such was demand.


  Horton is an artist specialising in printmaking, drawing and painting, and
  master paper restorer of Old Master drawings. Her world is paper - from
  hand-dyed, as fine as gossamer, to hand-made, with weight and texture. Pegged
  up in the studio, paper sheets hang like exotic laundry - richly coloured with
  patterns 'lifted' from surfaces such as old scoured printing plates - spotted
  and spangled to recreate the sawdust of the ring, the shimmer of an
  over-skirt, the speckledy-hen feathers of a chicken.


  Composing her narrative from a m&ecirc;lée of chosen themes from the past 16
  years, Horton weaves together tableaux that combine different elements of
  stage, dress and performance. The printing process she has developed is unique
  and labour intensive - her attention to detail immaculate, not surprising
  given her trade of almost forty years in restoration. She sketches first, then
  creates hard and soft ground etchings and chine collé that she scalpels out
  and collages onto canvases lined with Japanese kozo paper.


  The overall effect is glorious. Carolyn Horton's canvases of the circus are
  stunning, a visual treat of horsemen galloping round the ring, musicians in
  top hats, girls in exquisite costumes with doves, jugglers and acrobats teamed
  and focussed, and the art, charm and wit of exchange between players. In
  short, Horton captures the 'frissant' that makes the circus irresistible to us
  all. &copy; Jenny Blyth 2018.

  ### LONG DOGS & LINGERIE


  **&nbsp;FEBRUARY 2010&nbsp; The Gallery in Cork Street London W1&nbsp;**


  **APRIL – MAY 2010 Art Jericho, Oxford.**


  Jenny Blyth Fine Art shows new work by CAROLYN HORTON.


  Carolyn Horton’s experience has given her the authority to extend the medium
  of printmaking into new, uncharted directions…. ‘*The result is an
  extraordinary marriage of observation and imagination*’ Norman Ackroyd R.A.
  1997.&nbsp;


  Drawing on 45 years of drawing, printmaking and conservation, working with Old
  Master Prints and Drawings from Perugino to Picasso, Horton has stepped across
  from the invisible world of restoration to create her own work - an intimate
  world of paper.


  Art Deco sofa frames are upholstered in Japanese Kozo paper providing
  ‘canvases’ for her contemporary collage. Curled up or languishing amongst
  discarded dressing gowns, long dogs capture a moment in the day. Drawing on
  her love of the classical and an enjoyment of theatre, Horton prints onto
  hand-coloured or monotyped Kozo or Gampi paper composing a mélange of
  whippets, silk stockings and camisoles that are strewn across beds and trail
  over armchairs and screens. Delicate chine collée prints are collaged onto
  canvases to create compositions that are unique and beautifully executed.


  A graduate in Advanced Printmaking at Central St. Martin’s (1990-2) and Fine
  Art and Printmaking at Cheltenham College of Art (2001-4), Carolyn Horton was
  awarded an EEC Scholarship for Fresco Painting in Venice (1982) and the Prix
  de Rome at the French Academy for Conservation and Printmaking (1987-88). She
  worked in Florence, Venice, Lausanne, Oxford and Paris at The Uffizi, The
  Bodleian and The Louvre, and in California she studied conservation of Old
  Master drawings working with an array of Japanese paper, with her teacher and
  mentor, Keiko Keyes. She now lives and works from her studio in
  Buckinghamshire.
