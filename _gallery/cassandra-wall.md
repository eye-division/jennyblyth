  **SNOW INTO WATER** Curated by Jenny Blyth


  **Textile Paintings by Cassandra WALL and paintings by Chloe FREMANTLE**


  for The North Wall Arts Centre, Oxford OX2 7JN


  29 September - 10 October 2020


  The exhibition is a celebration of the beauty of Nature and its liberating and
  calming effect on the mind. Lockdown enforced a slowdown in the pace of life
  with all its noise and complexities, and accorded us a unique opportunity to
  hear the voice of the natural world around us, and the transience that makes
  it so precious.


  Cassandra Wall has been working with textiles since childhood. Her
  compositions in varying degrees of abstraction that capture the spirit of the
  landscape, are initiated *sur le motif.*&nbsp; Particularly, she is drawn to
  the longshore drift where the tides pile up and wash away the shingle,
  re-sculpting the littoral shoreline. &nbsp;***Dungeness: Summer and
  Winter***&nbsp;contrasts Derek Jarman's *Prospect Cottage,*&nbsp;lit from
  within on Winter nights with its wild Summer '*garden without
  borders*'.&nbsp;***Heather Hills*** features crests and waves of purple
  heather with backdrafts of golden-green mosses. Her collaged landscapes in
  torn papers are precursors to her textiles, with hints of the patterns and
  tessellations to come. Transposing her ‘sketches’ to cloth involves sourcing
  vintage and hand-coloured fabrics some of which she&nbsp; tones with tea,
  matching her swatches against her chosen subjects.


  Contemplating nature's glorious kaleidescope of beauty, there is ultimately an
  expression of meditative calm achieved through the patterning of colour and
  shape, and the juxtapositions that inform that simplicity and strength.


  Wall’s compositions, each created over months, present as contemporary textile
  'paintings' floating in tray frames, unglazed. Her language is colourfield
  abstraction towards a state of meditation, delighting in the journey that
  nature presents dancing towards that end.&nbsp; All is beautifully expressed
  as ***Snow Into Water*** where the white of falling snowflakes presiding in
  the sky, melts into the blue of waters below.
