  **SNOW INTO WATER** &nbsp;Curated by Jenny Blyth


  **Textile Paintings by Cassandra WALL and paintings by Chloe FREMANTLE**


  for The North Wall Arts Centre, Oxford OX2 7JN


  29 September - 10 October 2020


  The exhibition is a celebration of the beauty of Nature and its liberating and
  calming effect on the mind.&nbsp; Lockdown enforced a slowdown in pace of life
  in all its noise and complexities, giving us a unique opportunity to re-engage
  with the sheer beauty and voice of the natural world around us, and the
  transience that makes it so precious.


  Whether through painting or textile, artists **Chloe FREMANTLE** and
  **Cassandra WALL,** working both for thirty years and more, contemplate that
  beauty in nature expressed through patterning. &nbsp;In the expression of the
  multiplicity and noise in patterning, there is ultimately a meditative calm.


  Quilting and patchwork brings to mind the Amish Culture where strength is
  enhanced through simplicity.&nbsp; The repetition in patterning, of colour and
  shape, and the juxtapositions inform that simplicity and strength.


  Wall’s compositions, each created over months, present as contemporary textile
  paintings floating in tray frames, unglazed.&nbsp; Her methodology is
  hand-stitched patchwork, but her language is of tessellation and colourfield
  abstraction towards a state of meditation, delighting in the journey of colour
  and shape that nature presents dancing towards that end.&nbsp; All is
  beautifully expressed as ***Snow Into Water.***


  Cassandra Wall has been working with textiles since childhood. All her
  compositions such as ***Heather Hills*** are initiated *sur le
  motif*&nbsp;capturing the spirit of the landscape - the crests of purple
  heather-clad hills with backdrafts of golden green mosses.&nbsp; Initially,
  she creates collages in torn papers, precursors and hints of the patterns and
  tessellations to come.&nbsp; Transposing her ‘sketches’ to cloth, involves
  sourcing vintage and hand-coloured fabrics that she tones with tea, matching
  her swatches against her chosen subjects *en plein air*.&nbsp;


  Once her patterning is decided upon, the tessellation begins and her textile
  paintings are hand stitched : &nbsp;***Hastings*** : ***Net Sheds******;
  Dungeness : Winter and Summer (Derek Jarman’s Prospect Cottage on the
  shingle*&nbsp;at Dungeness); *Heather Hills*** in the Peak District; and
  ***Sunset Islands (Dodecanese)***; exquisite are her ***Autumn Floor*** with
  leaves underfoot, ***Impressionist Garden -*** *a Spring explosion*&nbsp;in
  fresh pinks and primrose yellows, and the golden hum of hexangonal
  ***Honeycomb***.
