  *‘When I think of art, I think of beauty. Beauty is the mystery of life. It is
  not in the eye, it is in the mind. In our minds there is awareness of
  perfection’.*  Agnes Martin


  Cassandra Wall composes moments in the landscape through colour and
  patterning.  Her textile ‘paintings’ are hand-stitched patchwork in cottons,
  colour-matched to her subject.  Although Cassandra acknowledges the origins of
  patchwork created out of thrift by women pioneers of 19th century America, her
  muses are contemporary Twentieth Century painters such as Agnes Martin, whose
  beautiful abstract expressionist paintings such as Drift of Summer celebrated
  the vast open spaces of the Saskatchewan prairies of her childhood. Also Anni
  Albers, pioneer of textile art and design, whose inspirations ranged from
  pre-Columbian art to Bauhaus.


  Inspiration considered, Cassandra’s intention is founded in her Buddhist
  practice of 30 years.  Celebrating nature and moments in the landscape has
  been the path for her in finding that quiet limitless space that we associate
  with meditation. The multiplicity of repetition in her patterning and use of
  colour impart a sense of oneness and inner calm that we seek from the natural
  world.


  Whether it is the shimmer of light on turquoise seas, or blossom falling in
  Spring, Cassandra’s textiles articulate a certain nuance of light, colour and
  mood.  Drinking Down the Light recreates the half-light of dusk over a Greek
  harbour infused with the indigos and lapiz blues of twilight. There is poetry
  and balm in her abstractions.  Upflight captures the flutter of wings as doves
  take flight, their feathers dusty pink and buff. Her tessellations are complex
  - snowflakes falling silently in Snow into Water - as whites give way to
  midnight blues.  Her Autumn Hedgerow is flush with damsons, sloes and
  rosehips.


  Cassandra’s working process involves an initial response to the landscape
  collaged from torn, hand-coloured and sourced papers juxtaposed. Her paper
  studies are figurative but inform the colour and rhythm of her textile
  abstractions.  These collages are stand-alone art works, but exhibited
  together with the ensuing textile, they make a beautiful pairing and a portal,
  one to the other.


  Dungeness: Summer and Winter is a seasonal depiction of Derek Jarman’s
  Prospect Cottage on the longshore drift on the South East Coast where the
  tides pile up and wash away the shingle, re-sculpting the littoral shoreline. 
  Stitched to create a quadrant of seasonality - the garden in summer is joyous
  in colour and form, set against the pared back winter landscape with ocean
  waves rolling in from The Channel.  Cassandra’s collaged study captures the
  outlook from a small cottage on the shingle of life, Jarman’s retreat during
  his final years. Her ‘textile painting’ celebrates both the fisherman’s shed
  ‘as was’, tarred in black with Jarman’s distinctive yellow window frames - and
  the beautiful ‘boundless’ garden that he planted with native flints, flowers
  and marine shrubs.  One can appreciate how his garden ‘without borders’
  resonates with Cassandra’s Buddhist practice where ‘form and void are one and
  the same’.


  In addition to a profound love of British landscape, from Heather Hills in the
  Peak District, to the Moon Tide series on the longshore drift of the Suffolk
  coast, Cassandra Wall has for decades explored Greece, capturing the magic of
  these ‘Islands of the Gods’ from Light on Grecian Seas, Ionian Islands to
  Dhodhekanisos, Sunset. Her textiles are experiential. They read as paintings,
  and thus we are able to share her moments in the landscape and immerse
  ourselves in the beauty of the world around us.


  **Snow Into Water** **2020** featured textile landscapes (figurative &
  abstracted) by **Cassandra Wall’s**  in a celebration of the beauty of Nature
  and its liberating and calming effect on the mind. Lockdown enforced a
  slowdown in the pace of life with all its noise and complexities, and accorded
  us a unique opportunity to hear the voice of the natural world around us, and
  the transience that makes it so precious.


  CW has been working with textiles since childhood. Her compositions in varying
  degrees of abstraction that capture the spirit of the landscape, are initiated
  *sur le motif.*&nbsp; Particularly, she is drawn to the longshore drift where
  the tides pile up and wash away the shingle, re-sculpting the littoral
  shoreline. ***Dungeness: Summer and Winter***&nbsp;contrasts Derek Jarman’s
  *Prospect Cottage,*&nbsp;lit from within on Winter nights, with its wild
  Summer ‘*garden without borders*’.&nbsp;***Heather Hills*** features crests
  and waves of purple heather with backdrafts of golden-green mosses. Her
  collaged landscapes in torn papers with hints of the patterns and
  tessellations to come, are precursors to her immaculately handstitched
  textiles. Transposing her ‘sketches’ to cloth involves sourcing vintage and
  hand-coloured fabrics some of which she tones with tea, matching her swatches
  against her chosen subjects.


  Contemplating nature’s kaleidescope of beauty, there is ultimately an
  expression of meditative calm achieved through the repetitions of colour and
  shape, and the juxtapositions that inform that simplicity and strength.


  Wall’s compositions, each created over months, present as contemporary textile
  ‘paintings’ floating in tray frames, unglazed. Her language is colourfield
  abstraction towards a state of meditation, delighting in the journey that
  nature presents dancing towards that end.&nbsp; All is beautifully expressed
  as ***Snow Into Water*** where the white of falling snowflakes from the sky
  melts into the blue of waters below.
