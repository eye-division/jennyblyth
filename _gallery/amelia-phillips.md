  ##AMELIA PHILLIPS at ART JERICHO  

  ## 19 MARCH - 19 APRIL 2015

  Amelia Phillips delights in the fractal patterning of transformation. Her etchings charter us on an exploration of an infinite and seemingly chaotic universe. Fascinated by the process of deterioration, the artist is constantly hunting down objects and surfaces that are weathered and transformed by both man and nature.

  Drawn to the worn appearance of these objects, Phillips work explores an absorbing sense of time’s passing, echoing the trail that it leaves behind.  Her art marvels at these temporal veins of the past, picking up the thread to embellish by hand the unending stories and surprises they tell.

  Through her present practice of printmaking and drawing, Amelia Phillips creates etchings that are organic in texture and sensibility, in pursuit of an unexpected and unconventional beauty.
