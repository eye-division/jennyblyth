      <p><strong>July 2023 : Evocations : Summer Exhibition of paintings by Chloe Fremantle, and more..</strong></p>
      <p>Beautiful summer paintings that reference colourfield, surrealism and abstraction.&nbsp; Chloe Fremantle is a member of the Royal Watercolour Society and has been painting and exhibiting internationally for forty years with work in international Collections. It is the artists of the 1930s and 40s who have been the most influential for Chloe Fremantle - Colour Field, Surrealist and Abstract artists such as Patrick Heron, Eileen Agar, Helen Frankenthaler, as well as Henri Matisse, Braque and Picasso, clearly her muses. Chloe has lived in New York, London and Italy, and now splits her studio time between London and the Alpes Maritime on the Cote d'Azur.&nbsp; Her paintings capture the light and joy of the Mediterranean imparting a sense of calm that she achieves despite the complexity of her compositions . The exhibition presents a selection of paintings from the 2022 London exhibition <em>Light Seeking Light </em>curated by Jenny Blyth at the Royal Watercolour Society, with paintings by Netta Carey, Anne Lynch, and ceramics by Alan Berman.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
