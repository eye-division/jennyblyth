      <p><strong>Coming Up&nbsp; 1/2 : Thursday 3 - 6 April 2025</strong> <strong>FRESH ART FAIR 2025 at Cheltenham</strong>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Jenny Blyth Fine Art : Stand 8&nbsp;</strong>: </p>

      <p>I am excited to be exhibiting unique prints, textiles, sculpture and ceramics by Susan MOXLEY.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Do join us at Cheltenham Art Fair which is held at Cheltenham Racecourse.&nbsp; Susan is an international artist, South African by birth, who has spent the past forty years working six months of the year from studio at home in the UK and six months at home in her studio on Kythera, in Greece. Her ceramic sculptures are a contemporary play on the simplicity and aesthetic of the ancient Cycladic female form with their flat planes and geometric shapes that so inspired Picasso. Her art is about is about women’s work, music and mythology, their place in the community and their relationship to the earth. The connection between Pithari (the Greek word for vessel) and Women, has been a recurring theme in Suzie’s practice for years – Woman as container, container as woman. Her Pithari and Violin Women are unique. Bisque or smoke-fired in stoneware and clay, they are all unglazed, .... and they have an honesty and integrity that is both simple and beautiful.</p>
      <p>Susan's Textiles are collaged from discarded vintage cloth that she has sourced across the island over years. Each piece is a palimpsest of her own creation infused with her thoughts and stories, but also with tales of their former use. Overstitching her narrative in thread onto her ‘collaged canvas’, she creates textile paintings of a Grecian Isle and community that remains beautiful and captivating in a fast-changing world.</p>
      <p>Do come and see Susan’s work at Jenny Blyth Fine Art : Stand 8 at Fresh Art Fair from Thursday 3 April (5.30-9 pm; Friday and Saturday from 11-6 pm; Sunday 11-5 pm.</p>
      <p><strong>Coming Up 2/2: 3-11 May 2025 ARTWEEKS : Jenny Blyth Photography</strong>&nbsp;: Across the Meadow and Beyond.</p>
      <p>Photographs of<em> Port Meadow </em>and<em> Oxford City, </em>and some of my favourite places such as <em>Blenheim</em> and the <em>Wantage Downs </em>above<em> Uffington, Oxfordshire</em>, and farther afield.</p>
      <p>Jenny Blyth Fine Art works with a portfolio of artists (below) to secure exhibitions and sales.</p>
      <p><em><strong>Click on Tabs above to view individual artists, images, prices, text and more.</strong></em></p>
      <p><strong>Day Bowman</strong> has a lifetime of painting under her belt creating beautiful abstracted paintings that explore geopolitics, borders, boundaries and migration. Raised in the West Country on the coast, her work is grounded in both the land and the outlying ocean as celebrated in her <em>Seaside Citadels</em> and <em>Marking the Boundary series.</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Chloe Fremantle</strong>&nbsp;is a true colourist composing visual haikus that have elements of synesthesia - a kaleidoscope of contemplations, evocations and reflections that invite us to travel down the rabbit hole.&nbsp; Ever inspired by the beauty of nature and architecture, her mark making has become a&nbsp; playful jazz fusion of motifs and elements developed over the years.&nbsp; Her compositions are joyous with perfect pitch on the canvas - a balance of colourfield, surrealism and abstraction.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Gerry Judah&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Faith, conflict and climate change have been at the heart of Judah’s work for fifteen years. His 3D white-on-white Angels, which document the devastation of war and the ravages to the Earth of climate change, have been shown internationally in museums and galleries with paintings and sculpture placed in public and private collections worldwide.<strong>&nbsp; </strong><em>Spirit of Water,</em> Gerry Judah's landmark public art piece, successfully installed at Calgary BMO Centre. <em>SOW</em>, a seminal sculpture of water droplet, standing 40' constructed from blue metal tubes, captures the splashback - that moment of impact.<em><strong> </strong></em></p>
      <p><strong>Anne Howeson</strong>&nbsp;is a storyteller supreme.&nbsp; Imagination is her medium, creating narrative with beautiful drawings laid over photography.&nbsp; Stepping across time, her compositions explore the avenues that interest her: the history of London; photography; the movement of people and relationships a life observed in Italy; and an ongoing examination of the relationships that she shares with her siblings. Whatever the subject, her work is haunting and unexpected.&nbsp; From Georgian London to distopian days ahead, her Kings Cross series cover a 300 year transition from buccolic pastures to the futuristic urbanity that is Kings X today - a history of lost rivers and the continuum of people passing through.&nbsp; New work titled&nbsp;<em>Volcanoes</em>, explore life and ghosts lived under Vesuvius where she has a rural retreat/studio. Her&nbsp;<em>Sister </em>series reflects on a childhood shared with siblings on the East Coast of Ireland.</p>
      <p><strong>Susan Moxley</strong>&nbsp;splits her year between UK and Kythera. Her work is infused with the colours and the song of a much loved Ionian isle, home to Aphrodite. Her textile paintings, prints and ceramic sculptures tell stories from ancient greek mythology to the changing culture she has observed over 40 years as younger generations embrace contemporary life. SM sees the island as a microcosm of what is happening in so many societies globally - socially, and also as a result of climate change. Blacklisted by her homeland of South Africa, SM moved to Europe to make her life as a young artist. Politics remain core to her work, with the role of women past and future ever present.

      <p><em><strong>Jenny Blyth Fine Art showed Susan Moxley at COLLECT 2025 in February/March 2025 and her work was widely admired and highlighted by World of Interiors.</strong></em></p>
      <p><strong>Cassandra Wall</strong> creates textile paintings that capture the rhythms of the elements and the natural world. Abstracting the landscape from studies collaged in paper, her tessellated patchwork compositions are hand stitched and dyed.&nbsp; It is the play of light on water, or the movement of saplings in woodlands, rather than the geography that informs her work. She has long been captivated by the longshore drift, whether that be Grecian isles or UK coastlines.&nbsp; Her textile landscapes are truly contemporary, beautifully coloured and composed. <em><strong>Showing with JBFA at The Sewell Gallery, Oxfordshire in September 2025.</strong></em></p>
      <p><strong>Trish Wylie</strong>&nbsp;is inspired by a passion for film. Painting with bold lines and flat planes of colour, her work is cinematographic and defies gender assumptions - her new series of <em>Desert Cowboys</em> capture the sheer energy and physicality of horse and rider in the saddle.&nbsp; Her paintings are inspired by iconic Westerns and film directors such Akira Kurosawa (The Seven Samurai), John Sturges (The Magnificent Seven) and John Huston (The Misfits), and the time she has spent alone in the Mojave Desert. Recent commissions include Olivia Colman as <em>The Queen</em>, and Joaquin Phoenix as Bonaparte.</p>
