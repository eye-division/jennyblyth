      <p><strong>Jenny Blyth Fine Art</strong> has a new home at <strong>CAREY BLYTH</strong> Gallery located in the heart of Oxford at the north end of St. Giles's. The gallery shows contemporary art for sale across all media - paintings, sculpture, printmaking and photography.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><em>'I find that I am chasing beauty and trust that you will find something beautiful in the gallery to savour for years to come.&nbsp; I have a profound love of the natural world and much of the art that I exhibit is grounded in the tradition of landscape and still life whether abstracted or figurative.</em><em></em></p>
      <p><em>Music and performance are also muse to artists inspriing andinforming their practice.&nbsp; In an age where we are overloaded with images it is rewarding to find art that is playful and challenging in equal measure, provoking contemplation and bringing joy.&nbsp; The artists on display are both local and national, each committed to exploring and creating fine art.</em>'</p>
      <p>The current show is <strong>SUMMER NIGHTS</strong> and captures that late summer night feeling of heat and colour.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>SUMMER NIGHTS</strong> features paintings by <strong>PAUL AMEY</strong> - paintings of backlit bars and night time swimming pools, <strong>FLORENCE AMEY</strong> - abstract expressionist paintings that encapsulate the colour and rigour of Spanish culture, <strong>CHLOE FREMANTLE</strong> - abstracted visual haikus inspired by the nature,&nbsp;<strong>CAROLYN HORTON</strong> - beautiful monotypes, hard and soft ground etchings collaged with chine colle onto paper wrapped canvas, <strong>MARTIN SMITH</strong> - sculpture 'fruits of the earth'.</p>
      <p>(See artist tabs in menu above to explore work)</p>
