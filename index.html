      <p><em><strong>Jenny Blyth Fine Art</strong>&nbsp;</em>at <strong>CAREY BLYTH</strong>&nbsp;<strong>GALLERY</strong>&nbsp;(Open: Tues-Sat : 11-5 pm)</p>
      <p>Located in the heart of Oxford at 8 Woodstock Road OX2 6HT, Carey Blyth Gallery shows contemporary art for sale by a stable of artists<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in solo and mixed exhibitions.</p>
      <p><em>'I find that I am chasing beauty and trust that you will find something beautiful in the gallery to savour for years to come.&nbsp; I have a profound love of the natural world and much of the art that I exhibit is grounded in the tradition of landscape and still life whether abstracted or figurative.' &nbsp; Jenny Blyth, curator &amp; gallerist.</em></p>
      <p>Click on Menu above to see images &amp; info on individual artists.&nbsp; See below for forthcoming and current projects.</p>
      <p><em><strong>Currently showing September 2021 :&nbsp;</strong></em><em><strong>GERRY JUDAH: 'Past &amp; Forward'</strong></em></p>
      <p>Judah trained at Goldsmith's and the Slade, working thereafter for twenty five years in Production Design. Set design particularly for Opera, Theatre and Ballet was an exciting outsource for his creativity. Judah is also known for his epic sculpture podiums at Goodwood for the Festival of Speed that captured the sheer excitement of Formula One. Returning to Fine Art in early 2000, Judah has work on permanent display at <em>St Paul's Cathedral</em>, London and <em>The Imperial Museum of the North,</em>&nbsp;Manchester.&nbsp; His sculpture is exhibited worldwide from UK to New Zealand.&nbsp; Conflict and sustainability have been the bedrock of his work.&nbsp; His beautiful drawings and sculptures on show at CBG through October/November are a response to a return visit to Bengal and Kolkata, the city of his early years.&nbsp; History, politics and faith pervade his work.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>BACKGROUND :&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p>Jenny Blyth has thirty years experience in contemporary art as curator and gallerist. She was Curator at Saatchi Gallery 1990-2002 and ran a floating gallery for ten years thereafter, originating projects and mounting exhibitions largely in London, Manchester and Oxford. Jenny Blyth Fine Art (JBFA) curated 40 exhibitions at Art Jericho in Oxford between 2010 and 2017, and opened Carey Blyth Gallery in September 2019.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Recent curatorial projects outside of the gallery include <em><strong>Seaside Citadels : Paintings by Day Bowman</strong></em> at Bermondsey Project Space, London SE1 (June 2021);&nbsp;<em><strong>Contemplation : Snow Into Water</strong></em>&nbsp; (September/October 2020) and&nbsp;<em><strong>Touching the Earth</strong></em>&nbsp;(May 2019) at North Wall Arts Centre, Oxford; and an exhibition of photography by Jenny Blyth&nbsp;<em><strong>Reflections in the Landscape</strong></em> at Wolfson College, Oxford (February 2019).</p>
