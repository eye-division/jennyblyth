      <p><strong>Coming Up....</strong></p>
      <p><strong> </strong></p>
      <p><strong> </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Cassandra WALL : </strong><em><strong>Drinking Up The Light</strong></em></p>
      <p><strong>5-25 September 2025</strong> at Sewell Centre Gallery, Radley College, Oxfordshire OX14 2HR</p>
      <p><strong>Opening : Friday 5 September from 6-8 pm</strong> : </p>
      <p>You are warmly welcome. <strong>RSVP</strong>: jennyblythart@gmail.com</p>
      <p><em>Whether it is the shimmer of light on Grecian seas or seasonal moontides and reflections, Cassandra Wall's textiles articulate a certain nuance of light, colour and mood.&nbsp; There is poetry and balm in her abstractions.</em>..</p>
      <p><strong>Jenny Blyth Fine Art</strong> works with a portfolio of artists <strong>(below)</strong> to secure exhibitions and sales.</p>

      <p><strong>Day Bowman</strong> has a lifetime of painting under her belt creating beautiful abstracted paintings that explore geopolitics, borders, boundaries and migration. Raised in the West Country on the coast, her work is grounded in both the land and the outlying ocean as celebrated in her <em>Seaside Citadels</em> and <em>Marking the Boundary series.</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Chloe Fremantle</strong>&nbsp;is a true colourist composing visual haikus that have elements of synesthesia - a kaleidoscope of contemplations, evocations and reflections that invite us to travel down the rabbit hole.&nbsp; Ever inspired by the beauty of nature and architecture, her mark making has become a&nbsp; playful jazz fusion of motifs and elements developed over the years.&nbsp; Her compositions are joyous with perfect pitch on the canvas - a balance of colourfield, surrealism and abstraction.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><strong>Gerry Judah&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Faith, conflict and climate change have been at the heart of Judahâ€™s work for fifteen years. His 3D white-on-white Angels, which document the devastation of war and the ravages to the Earth of climate change, have been shown internationally in museums and galleries with paintings and sculpture placed in public and private collections worldwide.<strong>&nbsp; </strong><em>Spirit of Water,</em> Gerry Judah's landmark public art piece, successfully installed at Calgary BMO Centre. <em>SOW</em>, a seminal sculpture of water droplet, standing 40' constructed from blue metal tubes, captures the splashback - that moment of impact.<em><strong> </strong></em></p>
      <p><strong>Anne Howeson</strong>&nbsp;is a storyteller supreme.&nbsp; Imagination is her medium, creating narrative with beautiful drawings laid over photography.&nbsp; Stepping across time, her compositions explore the avenues that interest her: the history of London; photography; the movement of people and relationships a life observed in Italy; and an ongoing examination of the relationships that she shares with her siblings. Whatever the subject, her work is haunting and unexpected.&nbsp; From Georgian London to distopian days ahead, her Kings Cross series cover a 300 year transition from buccolic pastures to the futuristic urbanity that is Kings X today - a history of lost rivers and the continuum of people passing through.&nbsp; New work titled&nbsp;<em>Volcanoes</em>, explore life and ghosts lived under Vesuvius where she has a rural retreat/studio. Her&nbsp;<em>Sister </em>series reflects on a childhood shared with siblings on the East Coast of Ireland.</p>
      <p><strong>Susan Moxley</strong>&nbsp;splits her year between UK and Kythera. Her work is infused with the colours and the song of a much loved Ionian isle, home to Aphrodite. Her textile paintings, prints and ceramic sculptures tell stories from ancient greek mythology to the changing culture she has observed over 40 years as younger generations embrace contemporary life. SM sees the island as a microcosm of what is happening in so many societies globally - socially, and also as a result of climate change. Blacklisted by her homeland of South Africa, SM moved to Europe to make her life as a young artist. Politics remain core to her work, with the role of women past and future ever present.

      <p><em><strong>JBFA showed Susan Moxley at Fresh Art Fair Cheltenham Racecourse 3-6 April and earlier this year at COLLECT 2025, Somerset House where her work was highlighted by World of Interiors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
      <p><strong>Cassandra Wall</strong> creates textile paintings that capture the rhythms of the elements and the natural world. Abstracting the landscape from studies collaged in paper, her tessellated patchwork compositions are hand stitched and dyed.&nbsp; It is the play of light on water, or the movement of saplings in woodlands, rather than the geography that informs her work. She has long been captivated by the longshore drift, whether that be Grecian isles or UK coastlines.&nbsp; Her textile landscapes are truly contemporary, beautifully coloured and composed. </p>
      <p><em><strong>Showing with JBFA at The Sewell Gallery, Oxfordshire in September 2025.</strong></em></p>
      <p><strong>Trish Wylie</strong>&nbsp;is inspired by a passion for film. Painting with bold lines and flat planes of colour, her work is cinematographic and defies gender assumptions - her new series of <em>Desert Cowboys</em> capture the sheer energy and physicality of horse and rider in the saddle.&nbsp; Her paintings are inspired by iconic Westerns and film directors such Akira Kurosawa (The Seven Samurai), John Sturges (The Magnificent Seven) and John Huston (The Misfits), and the time she has spent alone in the Mojave Desert. Recent commissions include Olivia Colman as <em>The Queen</em>, and Joaquin Phoenix as Bonaparte.</p>
